</div>
<p>With thick smoke in his throat and the roar
of flame in his ears, Pete No&euml;l awoke,
shaking as if in the grip of a nightmare. He sat
straight up in his bunk. Instantly he felt his face
scorching. The whole cabin was ablaze. Leaping
from his bunk, and dragging the blankets with him,
he sprang to the door, tore it open, and rushed out
into the snow.</p>
<p>But being a woodsman, and alert in every sense
like the creatures of the wild themselves, his wits
were awake almost before his body was, and his
instincts were even quicker than his wits. The
desolation and the savage cold of the wilderness
had admonished him even in that terrifying moment.
As he leaped out in desperate flight, he had snatched
with him not only the blankets, but his rifle and
cartridge-belt from where they stood by the head
of the bunk, and also his larrigans and great blanket
coat from where they lay by its foot. He had been
sleeping, according to custom, almost fully clothed.</p>
<p>Outside in the snow he stood, blinking through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
scorched and smarting lids at the destruction of his
shack. For a second or two he stared down at the
things he clutched in his arms, and wondered how
he had come to think of them in time. Then, realizing
with a pang that he needed something more than
clothes and a rifle, he flung them down on the snow
and made a dash for the cabin, in the hope of rescuing
a hunk of bacon or a loaf of his substantial
woodsman&#8217;s bread. But before he could reach the
door a licking flame shot out and hurled him back,
half blinded. Grabbing up a double handful of snow,
he buried his face in it to ease the smart. Then he
shook himself, coolly carried the treasures he had
saved back to a safe distance from the flames, and
sat down on the blankets to put on his larrigans.</p>
<p>His feet, clothed only in a single pair of thick
socks, were almost frozen, while the rest of his body
was roasting in the fierce heat of the conflagration.
It wanted about two hours of dawn. There was not
a breath of air stirring, and the flames shot straight
up, murky red and clear yellow intertwisting, with
here and there a sudden leaping tongue of violet
white. Outside the radius of the heat the tall woods
snapped sharply in the intense cold. It was so cold,
indeed, that as the man stood watching the ruin of
his little, lonely home, shielding his face from the
blaze now with one hand then with the other, his
back seemed turning to ice.</p>
<p>The man who lives alone in the great solitude of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
the forest has every chance to become a philosopher.
Pete No&euml;l was a philosopher. Instead of dwelling
upon the misfortunes which had smitten him, he
chose to consider his good luck in having got out of
the shack alive. Putting on his coat, he noted with
satisfaction that its spacious pockets contained
matches, tobacco, his pipe, his heavy clasp-knife, and
his mittens. He was a hundred miles from the
nearest settlement, fifty or sixty from the nearest
lumber-camp. He had no food. The snow was
four feet deep, and soft. And his trusty snowshoes,
which would have made these distances and these
difficulties of small account to him, were helping
feed the blaze. Nevertheless, he thought, things
might have been much worse. What if he had escaped
in his bare feet? This thought reminded him
of how cold his feet were at this moment. Well, the
old shack had been a good one, and sheltered him
well enough. Now that it would shelter him no
longer, it should at least be made to contribute something
more to his comfort. Piling his blankets carefully
under the shelter of a broad stump, he sat down
upon them. Then he filled and lighted his pipe,
leaned back luxuriously, and stretched out his feet to
the blaze. It would be time enough for him to &#8220;get
a move on&#8221; when the shack was quite burned down.
The shack was home as long as it lasted.</p>
<p>When the first mystic greyness, hard like steel
and transparent like glass, began to reveal strange
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
vistas among the ancient trees, the fire died down.
The shack was a heap of ashes and pulsating, scarlet
embers, with here and there a flickering, half-burned
timber, and the red-hot wreck of the tiny stove sticking
up in the ruins. As soon as the ruins were cool
enough to approach, Pete picked up a green pole,
and began poking earnestly among them. He had all
sorts of vague hopes. He particularly wanted his
axe, a tin kettle, and something to eat. The axe was
nowhere to be found, at least in such a search as
could then be made. The tins, obviously, had all
gone to pieces or melted. But he did, at least, scratch
out a black, charred lump about the size of his
fist, which gave forth an appetizing smell. When
the burnt outside had been carefully scraped off,
it proved to be the remnant of a side of bacon.
Pete fell to his breakfast with about as much ceremony
as might have sufficed a hungry wolf, the
deprivation of a roof-tree having already taken him
back appreciably nearer to the elemental brute.
Having devoured his burnt bacon, and quenched
his thirst by squeezing some half-melted snow into a
cup of birch-bark, he rolled his blankets into a handy
pack, squared his shoulders, and took the trail
for Conroy&#8217;s Camp, fifty miles southwestward.</p>
<p>It was now that Pete No&euml;l began to realize the
perils that confronted him. Without his snowshoes,
he found himself almost helpless. Along
the trail the snow was from three to four feet deep,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
and soft. There had been no thaws and no hard
winds to pack it down. After floundering ahead
for four or five hundred yards he would have to
stop and rest, half reclining. In spite of the ferocious
cold, he was soon drenched with sweat. After
a couple of hours of such work, he found himself
consumed with thirst. He had nothing to melt the
snow in; and, needless to say, he knew better than
to ease his need by eating the snow itself. But he
hit upon a plan which filled him with self-gratulation.
Lighting a tiny fire beside the trail, under the shelter
of a huge hemlock, he took off his red cotton neckerchief,
filled it with snow, and held it to the flames.
As the snow began to melt, he squeezed the water
from it in a liberal stream. But, alas! the stream
was of a colour that was not enticing. He realized,
with a little qualm, that it had not occurred to him to
wash that handkerchief since&ndash;&ndash;well, he was unwilling
to say when. For all the insistence of his thirst,
therefore, he continued melting the snow and squeezing
it out, till the resulting stream ran reasonably
clear. Then patiently he drank, and afterward
smoked three pipefuls of his rank, black tobacco as
substitute for the square meal which his stomach
was craving.</p>
<p>All through the biting silent day he floundered
resolutely on, every now and then drawing his belt
a little tighter, and all the while keeping a hungry
watch for game of some kind. What he hoped for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
was rabbit, partridge, or even a fat porcupine; but
he would have made a shift to stomach even the
wiry muscles of a mink, and count himself fortunate.
By sunset he came out on the edge of a vast barren,
glorious in washes of thin gold and desolate purple
under the touch of the fading west. Along to eastward
ran a low ridge, years ago licked by fire, and
now crested with a sparse line of ghostly rampikes,
their lean, naked tops appealing to the inexorable
sky. This was the head of the Big Barren. With
deep disgust, and something like a qualm of apprehension,
Pete No&euml;l reflected that he had made only
fifteen miles in that long day of effort. And he was
ravenously hungry. Well, he was too tired to go
farther that night; and in default of a meal, the
best thing he could do was sleep. First, however,
he unlaced his larrigans, and with the thongs made
shift to set a clumsy snare in a rabbit track a few
paces back among the spruces. Then, close under
the lee of a black wall of fir-trees standing out beyond
the forest skirts, he clawed himself a deep trench
in the snow. In one end of this trench he built a
little fire, of broken deadwood and green birch saplings
laboriously hacked into short lengths with his
clasp-knife. A supply of this firewood, dry and
green mixed, he piled beside the trench within
reach. The bottom of the trench, to within a couple
of feet of the fire, he lined six inches deep with spruce-boughs,
making a dry, elastic bed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span></p>
<p>By the time these preparations were completed,
the sharp-starred winter night had settled down
upon the solitude. In all the vast there was no
sound but the occasional snap, hollow and startling,
of some great tree overstrung by the frost, and the
intimate little whisper and hiss of Pete&#8217;s fire down in
the trench. Disposing a good bunch of boughs
under his head, Pete lighted his pipe, rolled himself
in his blankets, and lay down with his feet to the
fire.</p>
<p>There at the bottom of his trench, comforted by
pipe and fire, hidden away from the emptiness of the
enormous, voiceless world outside, Pete No&euml;l looked
up at the icy stars, and at the top of the frowning
black rampart of the fir-trees, touched grimly
with red flashes from his fire. He knew well&ndash;&ndash;none
better than he&ndash;&ndash;the savage and implacable sternness
of the wild. He knew how dreadful the silent
adversary against whom he had been called, all
unprepared, to pit his craft. There was no blinking
the imminence of his peril. Hitherto he had always
managed to work, more or less, <i>with</i> nature, and so
had come to regard the elemental forces as friendly.
Now they had turned upon him altogether and
without warning. His anger rose as he realized
that he was at bay. The indomitable man-spirit
awoke with the anger. Sitting up suddenly, over
the edge of the trench his deep eyes looked out upon
the shadowy spaces of the night with challenge and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
defiance. Against whatever odds, he declared to
himself, he was master. Having made his proclamation
in that look, Pete No&euml;l lay down again and
went to sleep.</p>
<p>After the fashion of winter campers and of woodsmen
generally, he awoke every hour or so to replenish
the fire; but toward morning he sank into the
heavy sleep of fatigue. When he aroused himself
from this, the fire was stone grey, the sky overhead
was whitish, flecked with pink streamers, and rose-pink
lights flushed delicately the green wall of the
fir-trees leaning above him. The edges of the
blankets around his face were rigid and thick with
ice from his breathing. Breaking them away
roughly, he sat up, cursed himself for having let the
fire out, then, with his eyes just above the edge of
the trench, peered forth across the shining waste.
As he did so, he instinctively shrank back into concealment.
An eager light flamed into his eyes, and
he blessed his luck that the fire had gone out.
Along the crest of the ridge, among the rampikes,
silhouetted dark and large against the sunrise, moved
a great herd of caribou, feeding as they went.</p>
<p>Crouching low in his trench, Pete hurriedly did
up his blankets, fixed the pack on his back, then
crawled through the snow into the shelter of the fir-woods.
As soon as he was out of sight, he arose,
recovered the thongs of his larrigans from the futile
snare, and made his way back on the trail as fast as he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
could flounder. That one glance over the edge of
his trench had told his trained eye all he needed to
know about the situation.</p>
<p>The caribou, most restless, capricious, and far-wandering
of all the wilderness kindreds, were drifting
south on one of their apparently aimless migrations.
They were travelling on the ridge, because,
as Pete instantly inferred, the snow there had been
partly blown away, partly packed, by the unbroken
winds. They were far out of gunshot. But he was
going to trail them down even through that deep
snow. By tireless persistence and craft he would
do it, if he had to do it on his hands and knees.</p>
<p>Such wind as there was, a light but bitter air
drawing irregularly down out of the north-west,
blew directly from the man to the herd, which was
too far off, however, to catch the ominous taint and
take alarm. Pete&#8217;s first care was to work around
behind the herd till this danger should be quite
eliminated. For a time his hunger was forgotten
in the interest of the hunt; but presently, as he toiled
his slow way through the deep of the forest, it
grew too insistent to be ignored. He paused to
strip bark from such seedlings of balsam fir as he
chanced upon, scraping off and devouring the thin,
sweetish pulp that lies between the bark and the
mature wood. He gathered, also, the spicy tips
of the birch-buds, chewing them up by handfuls
and spitting out the residue of hard husks. And in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
this way he managed at least to soothe down his
appetite from angry protest to a kind of doubtful
expectancy.</p>
<p>At last, after a couple of hours&#8217; hard floundering,
the woods thinned, the ground sloped upward, and
he came out upon the flank of the ridge, a long way
behind the herd, indeed, but well around the wind.
In the trail of the herd the snow was broken up, and
not more than a foot and a half in depth. On
a likely-looking hillock he scraped it away carefully
with his feet, till he reached the ground; and here
he found what he expected&ndash;&ndash;a few crimson berries
of the wintergreen, frozen, but plump and sweet-fleshed.
Half a handful of these served for the
moment to cajole his hunger, and he pressed briskly
but warily along the ridge, availing himself of the
shelter of every rampike in his path. At last, catching
sight of the hindmost stragglers of the herd, still
far out of range, he crouched like a cat, and crossed
over the crest of the ridge for better concealment.</p>
<p>On the eastern slope the ridge carried numerous
thickets of underbrush. From one to another of
these Pete crept swiftly, at a rate which should
bring him, in perhaps an hour, abreast of the
leisurely moving herd. In an hour, then, he crawled
up to the crest again, under cover of a low patch
of juniper scrub. Confidently he peered through
the scrub, his rifle ready. But his face grew black
with bitter disappointment. The capricious beasts
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
had gone. Seized by one of their incomprehensible
vagaries&ndash;&ndash;Pete was certain that he had not alarmed
them&ndash;&ndash;they were now far out on the white level,
labouring heavily southward.</p>
<p>Pete set his jaws resolutely. Hunger and cold,
each the mightier from their alliance, were now
assailing him savagely. His first impulse was to
throw off all concealment and rush straight down
the broad-trodden trail. But on second thought he
decided that he would lose more than he would gain
by such tactics. Hampered though they were by
the deep, soft snow, he knew that, once frightened,
they could travel through it much faster than they
were now moving, and very much faster than he
could hope to follow. Assuredly, patience was
his game. Slipping furtively from rampike to
rampike, now creeping, now worming his way like
a snake, he made good time down to the very
edge of the level. Then, concealment no more
possible, and the rear of the herd still beyond gunshot,
he emerged boldly from the covert of a clump
of saplings and started in pursuit. At the sight
of him, every antlered head went up in the air for
one moment of wondering alarm; then, through a
rolling white cloud the herd fled onward at a speed
which Pete, with all his knowledge of their powers,
had not imagined possible in such a state of the
snow. Sullen, but not discouraged, he plodded after
them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></p>
<p>No&euml;l was now fairly obsessed with the one idea
of overtaking the herd. Every other thought, sense,
or faculty was dully occupied with his hunger and
his effort to keep from thinking of it. Hour after
hour he plodded on, following the wide, chaotic
trail across the white silence of the barren. There
was nothing to lift his eyes for, so he kept them
automatically occupied in saving his strength
by picking the easiest steps through the ploughed
snow. He did not notice at all that the sun no longer
sparkled over the waste. He did not notice that
the sky had turned from hard blue to ghostly
pallor. He did not notice that the wind, now
blowing in his teeth, had greatly increased in force.
Suddenly, however, he was aroused by a swirl of
fine snow driven so fiercely that it crossed his face
like a lash. Lifting his eyes from the trail, he saw
that the plain all about him was blotted from
sight by a streaming rout of snow-clouds. The wind
was already whining its strange derisive menace in
his face. The blizzard had him.</p>
<p>As the full fury of the storm swooped upon him,
enwrapping him, and clutching at his breath, for an
instant Pete No&euml;l quailed. This was a new adversary,
with whom he had not braced his nerves to
grapple. But it was for an instant only. Then his
weary spirit lifted itself, and he looked grimly into
the eye of the storm. The cold, the storm, the
hunger, he would face them all down, and win out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
yet. Lowering his head, and pulling a flap of his
blanket coat across his mouth to make breathing
easier, he plunged straight forward with what
seemed like a new lease of vigour.</p>
<p>Had the woods been near, or had he taken note
of the weather in time, Pete would have made for
the shelter of the forest at once. But he knew
that, when last he looked, the track of the herd had
been straight down the middle of the ever-widening
barren. By now he must be a good two miles from
the nearest cover; and he knew well enough that,
in the bewilderment of the storm, which blunted
even such woodcraft as his, and blurred not only
his vision, but every other sense as well, he could
never find his way. His only hope was to keep to
the trail of the caribou. The beasts would either lie
down or circle to the woods. In such a storm as
this, as he knew well enough, no animal but man
himself could hunt, or follow up the trail. There was
no one but man who could confront such a storm
undaunted. The caribou would forget both their
cunning and the knowledge that they were being
hunted. He would come upon them, or they
would lead him to shelter. With an obstinate
pride in his superiority to the other creatures of the
wilderness, he scowled defiantly at the storm, and
because he was overwrought with hunger and
fatigue, he muttered to himself as he went, cursing
the elements that assailed him so relentlessly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></p>
<p>For hours he floundered on doggedly, keeping
the trail by feeling rather than by sight, so thick were
the cutting swirls of snow. As the drift heaped
denser and denser about his legs, the terrible
effort, so long sustained, began to tell on him, till his
progress became only a snail&#8217;s pace. Little by little,
in the obstinate effort to conserve strength and
vitality, his faculties all withdrew into themselves,
and concentrated themselves upon the one purpose&ndash;&ndash;to
keep going onward. He began to feel the lure
of just giving up. He began to think of the warmth
and rest he could get, the release from the mad
chaos of the wind, by the simple expedient of burrowing
deep into the deep snow. He knew well
enough that simple trick of the partridge, when frost
and storm grow too ferocious for it. But his wiser
spirit would not let him delude himself. Had he
had a full stomach, and food in his pockets, he might,
perhaps, safely have emulated this cunning trick
of the partridge. But now, starving, weary, his
vitality at the last ebb, he knew that if he should
yield to the lure of the snow, he would be seen no
more till the spring sun should reveal him, a thing
of horror to the returning vireos and blackbirds, on
the open, greening face of the barren. No, he
would not burrow to escape the wind. He laughed
aloud as he thought upon the madness of it; and
went butting and plunging on into the storm, indomitable.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></p>
<p>Suddenly, however, he stopped short, with a great
sinking at his heart. He felt cautiously this way
and that, first with his feet, fumbling through the
deep snow, and then with his hands. At last he
turned his back abruptly to the wind, cowered down
with his head between his arms to shut out the devilish
whistling and whining, and tried to think how
or when it had happened. He had lost the trail of
the herd!</p>
<p>All his faculties stung to keen wakefulness by
this appalling knowledge, he understood how it
happened, but not where. The drifts had filled the
trail, till it was utterly blotted off the face of the
plain; then he had kept straight on, guided by the
pressure of the wind. But the caribou, meanwhile,
had swerved, and moved off in another direction.
Which direction? He had to acknowledge to himself
that he had no clue to judge by, so whimsical
were these antlered vagrants of the barren. Well,
he thought doggedly, let them go! He would get
along without them. Staggering to his feet, he
faced the gale again, and thought hard, striving to
remember what the direction of the wind had been
when last he observed it, and at the same time to
recall the lay of the heavy-timbered forest that skirted
this barren on two sides.</p>
<p>At length he made up his mind where the nearest
point of woods must be. He saw it in his mind&#8217;s
eye, a great promontory of black firs jutting out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
into the waste. He turned, calculating warily,
till the wind came whipping full upon his left cheek.
Sure that he was now facing his one possible refuge,
he again struggled forward. And as he went, he
pictured to himself the whole caribou herd, now
half foundered in the drift, labouring toward the same
retreat. Once more, crushing back hunger and
faintness, he summoned up his spirit, and vowed
that if the beasts could fight their way to cover, he
could. Then his woodcraft should force the forest
to render him something in the way of food that would
suffice to keep life in his veins.</p>
<p>For perhaps half an hour this defiant and unvanquishable
spirit kept Pete No&euml;l going. But
as the brief northern day began to wane, and a
shadow to darken behind the thick, white gloom of
the storm, his forces, his tough, corded muscles
and his tempered nerves, again began to falter.
He caught himself stumbling, and seeking excuse
for delay in getting up. In spite of every effort of
his will, he saw visions&ndash;&ndash;thick, protecting woods
close at one side or the other, or a snug log camp,
half buried in the drifts, but with warm light flooding
from its windows. Indignantly he would shake
himself back into sanity, and the delectable visions
would vanish. But while they lasted they were confusing,
and presently when he aroused himself from
one that was of particularly heart-breaking vividness,
he found that he had let his rifle drop! It was gone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
hopelessly. The shock steadied him for some minutes.
Well, he had his knife. After all, that was the more
important of the two. He ploughed onward, once
more keenly awake, and grappling with his fate.</p>
<p>The shadows thickened rapidly; and at last,
bending with the insane riot of the storm, began to
make strange, monstrous shapes. Unravelling these
illusions, and exorcising them, kept Pete No&euml;l
occupied. But suddenly one of these monstrous
shapes neglected to vanish. He was just about to
throw himself upon it, in half delirious antagonism,
when it lurched upward with a snort, and struggled
away from him. In an instant Pete was alive in
every faculty, stung with an ecstasy of hope. Leaping,
floundering, squirming, he followed, open knife
in hand. Again and yet again the foundered beast, a
big caribou bull, buried halfway up the flank, eluded
him. Then, as his savage scramble at last overtook
it, the bull managed to turn half about, and
thrust him violently in the left shoulder with an antler-point.
Unheeding the hurt, No&euml;l clutched the antler
with his left hand, and forced it inexorably back.
The next moment his knife was drawn with practised
skill across the beast&#8217;s throat.</p>
<p>Like most of our eastern woodsmen, Pete No&euml;l
was even finicky about his food, and took all his
meat cooked to a brown. He loathed underdone
flesh. Now, however, he was an elemental creature,
battling with the elements for his life. And he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
knew, moreover, that of all possible restoratives,
the best was at his hand. He drove his blade again,
this time to the bull&#8217;s heart. As the wild life sighed
itself out, and vanished, Pete crouched down like
an animal, and drank the warm, red fluid streaming
from the victim&#8217;s throat. As he did so, the ebbed
tide of warmth, power, and mastery flooded back
into his own veins. He drank his fill; then, burrowing
half beneath the massive body, he lay down close
against it to rest and consider.</p>
<p>Assured now of food to sustain him on the journey,
assured of his own ability to master all other obstacles
that might seek to withstand him, Pete
No&euml;l made up his mind to sleep, wrapping himself
in his blankets under the shelter of the dead bull.
Then the old hunter&#8217;s instinct began to stir. All
about him, in every momentary lull of the wind,
were snortings and heavy breathings. He had
wandered into the midst of the exhausted herd.
Here was a chance to recoup himself, in some small
part, for the loss of his cabin and supplies. He could
kill a few of the helpless animals, hide them in the
snow, and take the bearings of the spot as soon as the
weather cleared. By and by he could get a team
from the nearest settlement, and haul out the frozen
meat for private sale when the game warden chanced
to have his eyes shut.</p>

</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></div>
<p>Getting out his knife again, he crept stealthily
toward the nearest heavy breathing. Before he
could detect the beast in that tumultuous gloom, he
was upon it. His outstretched left hand fell upon
a wildly heaving flank. The frightened animal
arose with a gasping snort, and tried to escape;
but utterly exhausted, it sank down again almost
immediately, resigned to this unknown doom which
stole upon it out of the tempest and the dark.
Pete&#8217;s hand was on it again the moment it was
still. He felt it quiver and shrink beneath his touch.
Instinctively he began to stroke and rub the stiff
hair as he slipped his treacherous hand forward
along the heaving flank. The heavings grew quieter,
the frightened snortings ceased. The exhausted
animal seemed to feel a reassurance in that strong,
quiet touch.</p>
<p>When Pete&#8217;s hand had reached the unresisting
beast&#8217;s neck, he began to feel a qualm of misgiving.
His knife was in the other hand, ready for use there
in the howling dark; but somehow he could not at
once bring himself to use it. It would be a betrayal.
Yet he had suffered a grievous loss, and here, given
into his grasp by fate, was the compensation. He
hesitated, arguing with himself impatiently. But
even as he did so, he kept stroking that firm, warm,
living neck; and through the contact there in the
savage darkness, a sympathy passed between the
man and the beast. He could not help it. The
poor beasts and he were in the same predicament,
together holding the battlements of life against the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
blind and brutal madness of storm. Moreover, the
herd had saved him. The debt was on his side.
The caress which had been so traitorous grew honest
and kind. With a shamefaced grin Pete shut his
knife, and slipped it back into his pocket.</p>
<p>With both hands, now, he stroked the tranquil
caribou, rubbing it behind the ears and at the base
of the antlers, which seemed to give it satisfaction.
Once when his hand strayed down the long muzzle,
the animal gave a terrified start and snort at the
dreaded man smell so violently invading its nostrils.
But Pete kept on soothingly and firmly; and again
the beast grew calm. At length Pete decided that his
best place for the night, or until the storm should
lift, would be by the warmth of this imprisoned and
peaceable animal. Digging down into the snow
beyond the clutches of the wind, he rolled himself
in his blankets, crouched close against the caribou&#8217;s
flank, and went confidently to sleep.</p>
<p>Aware of living companionship, No&euml;l slept soundly
through the clamour of the storm. At last a movement
against his side disturbed him. He woke to
feel that his strange bedfellow had struggled up and
withdrawn. The storm was over. The sky above
his upturned face was sharp with stars. All about
him was laboured movement, with heavy shuffling,
coughing, and snorting. Forgetful of their customary
noiselessness, the caribou were breaking gladly
from their imprisonment. Presently Pete was alone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
The cold was still and of snapping intensity; but
he, deep in his hollow, and wrapped in his blankets,
was warm. Still drowsy, he muffled his face and
went to sleep again for another hour.</p>
<p>When he roused himself a second time he was
wide awake and refreshed. It was just past the
edge of dawn. The cold gripped like a vice. Faint
mystic hues seemed frozen for ever into the ineffable
crystal of the air. Pete stood up, and looked eastward
along the tumbled trail of the herd. Not half a
mile away stood the forest, black and vast, the trail
leading straight into it. Then, a little farther down
toward the right he saw something that made his
heart leap exultantly. Rising straight up, a lavender
and silver lily against the pallid saffron of the
east, soared a slender smoke. That smoke, his trained
eyes told him, came from a camp chimney; and he
realized that the lumbermen had moved up to him
from the far-off head of the Ottanoonsis.</p>

<h2><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>MacPhairrson&#8217;s Happy Family</span></h2>
</div>
<p style='text-align:center; margin:1em auto 1.5em auto;'>I</p>
<p>It was over a little footbridge one had to pass to
visit MacPhairrson and his family, a little,
lofty, curiously constructed footbridge, spanning a
narrow but very furious torrent. At the middle of
the bridge was a gate&ndash;&ndash;or, rather, a door&ndash;&ndash;of close
and strong wire mesh; and at this point, door and
bridge together were encircled by a <i>chevaux-de-frise</i>
of woodwork with sharp, radiating points of heavy
telegraph wire. With the gate shut, nothing less
than a pair of wings in good working order could
carry one over to the steep little island in mid-torrent
which was MacPhairrson&#8217;s home and
citadel.</p>
<p>Carried caressingly in the hollow of his left arm, the
Boy held a brown burlap bag, which wriggled violently
at times and had to be soothed into quiescence.
When the Boy arrived at the door in the bridge,
which he found locked, he was met by two strange
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
hosts who peered at him wisely through the meshes
of the door. One of these was a large black and tan
dog, with the long body, wavy hair, drooping silken
ears, and richly feathered tail of a Gordon setter,
most grotesquely supported, at a height of not more
than eight inches from the ground, by the little
bow-legs of a dachshund. This freakish and sinister-looking
animal gazed at the visitor with eyes of
sagacious welcome, tongue hanging amiably half out,
and tail gently waving. He approved of this particular
Boy, though boys in general he regarded as
nuisances to be tolerated rather than encouraged.
The other host, standing close beside the dog as if on
guard, and scrutinizing the visitor with little, pale,
shrewdly non-committal eyes, was a half-grown black
and white pig.</p>
<p>Through the gate the Boy murmured familiar
greetings to its warders while he pulled a wooden
handle which set an old brown cow-bell above the
door jangling hoarsely. The summer air was full
to brimming over with sound&ndash;&ndash;with the roar of the
furious little torrent beneath, with the thunder of
the sheet of cream and amber water falling over the
face of the dam some fifty yards above, with the
hiss and shriek of the saws in the big sawmill perched
beside the dam. Yet through all the interwoven
tissue of noise the note of the cow-bell made itself
heard in the cabin. From behind the cabin arose a
sonorous cry of <i>hong-ka, honk-a-honk</i>, and the snaky
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
black head of a big Canada goose appeared inquiringly
around the corner. On one end of the
hewn log which served as doorstep a preternaturally
large and fat woodchuck sat bolt upright and stared
to see who was coming. A red fox, which had been
curled up asleep under MacPhairrson&#8217;s one rose
bush, awoke, and superciliously withdrew to the
other side of the island, out of sight, disapproving
of all visitors on principle. From the shade of a
thick spruce bush near the bridge-end a moose calf
lumbered lazily to her feet, and stood staring, her
head low down and her big ears waving in sleepy
interrogation. From within the cabin came a
series of harsh screeches mixed with discordant
laughter and cries of &#8220;Ebenezer! Ebenezer! Oh,
by Gee! Hullo!&#8221; Then the cabin door swung
wide, and in the doorway appeared MacPhairrson,
leaning on his crutches, a green parrot on his
shoulder, and beside his crippled feet two big white
cats.</p>
<p>MacPhairrson, the parrot, and the cats, all together
stared hard at the door on the bridge, striving
to make out through the meshes who the visitor
might be. The parrot, scrutinizing fiercely with her
sinister black and orange eyes, was the first to discover.
She proclaimed at once her discovery and
her approval by screeching, &#8220;Boy! Boy! Oh, by
Gee! Hullo!&#8221; and clambering head-first down the
front of MacPhairrson&#8217;s coat. As MacPhairrson
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
hobbled hastily forward to admit the welcome guest,
the parrot, reaching out with beak and claw, transferred
herself to the moving crutch, whence she made
a futile snap at one of the white cats. Foiled in
this amiable attempt, she climbed hurriedly up the
crutch again and resumed MacPhairrson&#8217;s shoulder,
in time to greet the Boy&#8217;s entrance with a cordial
&#8220;Oh, by Gee! Hullo!&#8221;</p>
<p>MacPhairrson (he spelled his name scrupulously
MacPherson, but, like all the other dwellers in the
Settlement, pronounced it MacPhairrson, with a
punctilious rolling of the r) was an old lumberman.
Rheumatism, brought on by years of toiling thigh-deep
in the icy waters when the logs were running in
the freshets, had gripped him so relentlessly that one
of his legs was twisted to almost utter uselessness.
With his crutches, however, he could get about after
his fashion; and being handy with his fingers and
versatile of wit, he managed to make a living well
enough at the little odd jobs of mechanical repairing
which the Settlement folk, and the mill hands in
particular, brought to his cabin. His cabin, which
was practically a citadel, stood on a steep cone of
rock, upthrust from the bed of the wild little river
which worked the mill. On the summit of a rock
a few square rods of soil gave room for the cabin, half
a dozen bushes, and some sandy, sun-warmed turf.
In this retreat, within fifty yards of the busy mill,
but fenced about by the foaming torrent and quite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
inaccessible except by the footbridge, MacPhairrson
lived with the motley group of companions which
men called his Happy Family.</p>
<p>Happy, no doubt, they were, in spite of the strait
confines of their prison, for MacPhairrson ruled
them by the joint forces of authority and love. He
had, moreover, the mystic understanding which is
essential if one would be really intimate with the
kindreds we carelessly call dumb. So it was that he
achieved a fair degree of concord in his Family.
All the creatures were amiable towards him, because
they loved him; and because they wholesomely
feared him, they were amiable in the main towards
each other. There were certain members of the
Family who might be described as perennial. They
were of the nature of established institutions. Such
were Stumpy, the freak-legged dachshund-setter;
James Edward, the wild gander; Butters, the
woodchuck; Melindy and Jim, the two white cats;
Bones, the brown owl, who sat all day on the edge of
a box in the darkest corner of the cabin; and
Ananias-and-Sapphira, the green parrot, so named,
as MacPhairrson was wont to explain, because she
was so human and he never could quite make her
out. Ebenezer, the pig, was still too young to be
promoted to permanence; but he had already
shown such character, intelligence, and self-respecting
individuality that MacPhairrson had vowed he
should never deteriorate into pork. Ebenezer should
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
stay, even though he should grow so big as to be
inconvenient.</p>
<p>But with Susan, the moose calf, and Carrots, the
unsociable young fox, it was different. MacPhairrson
realized that when Susan should come to her full
heritage of stature, he would hardly have room for
her on the island. He would then send to the Game
Commissioner at Fredericton for a permit, and
sell the good soul to the agent for some Zo&ouml;logical
Garden, where she would be appreciated and cared
for. As for Carrots, his conduct was irreproachable,
absolutely without blot or blemish, but MacPhairrson
knew that he was quite unregenerate at heart.
The astute little beast understood well enough the
fundamental law of the Family, &#8220;Live and let
live,&#8221; and he knew that if he should break that law,
doom would descend upon him in an eye-wink. But
into his narrowed, inscrutable eyes, as he lay with
muzzle on dainty, outstretched black paws and
watched the movements of James Edward, the
gander, or Butters, the fat woodchuck, a savage
glint would come, which MacPhairrson unerringly
interpreted. Moreover, while his demeanour was
impeccable, his reserve was impenetrable, and
even the tolerant and kindly MacPhairrson could
find nothing in him to love. The decree, therefore,
had gone forth; that is, it had been announced by
MacPhairrson himself, and apparently approved
by the ever attentive Stumpy and Ebenezer, that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
Carrots should be sold into exile at the very first opportunity.</p>
<p>When the Boy came through the little bridge
gate, the greetings between him and MacPhairrson
were brief and quiet. They were fellows both in the
taciturn brotherhood of the woods. To Stumpy and
Ebenezer, who nosed affectionately at his legs, he
paid no attention beyond a careless touch of caress.
Even to Ananias-and-Sapphira, who had hurriedly
clambered from MacPhairrson&#8217;s shoulder to his
and begun softly nipping at his ear with her dreaded
beak, he gave no heed whatever. He knew that the
evil-tempered bird loved him as she loved his master
and would be scrupulously careful not to pinch too
hard.</p>
<p>As the little procession moved gravely and silently
up from the bridge to the cabin, their silence was in
no way conspicuous, for the whole air throbbed with
the rising and falling shriek of the saws, the trampling
of the falls, and the obscurely rhythmic rush of
the torrent around the island base. They were
presently joined by Susan, shambling on her ungainly
legs, wagging her big ears, and stretching out
her long, ugly, flexible, overhanging nose to sniff
inquiringly at the Boy&#8217;s jacket. A comparatively
new member of MacPhairrson&#8217;s family, she was still
full of curiosity about every one and everything,
and obviously considered it her mission in life
to acquire knowledge. It was her firm conviction
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
that the only way to know a thing was to
smell it.</p>
<p>A few steps from the door James Edward, the
wild gander, came forward with dignity, slightly
bowing his long, graceful black neck and narrow
snaky head as he moved. Had the Boy been a
stranger, he would now have met the first touch of
hostility. Not all MacPhairrson&#8217;s manifest favour
would have prevented the uncompromising and
dauntless gander from greeting the visitor with a
savage hiss and uplifted wings of defiance. But
towards the Boy, whom he knew well, his dark,
sagacious eye expressed only tolerance, which from
him was no small condescension.</p>
<p>On the doorstep, as austerely ungracious in his
welcome as James Edward himself, sat Butters,
the woodchuck, nursing some secret grudge against
the world in general, or, possibly, against Ananias-and-Sapphira
in particular, with whom he was on
terms of vigilant neutrality. When the procession
approached, he forsook the doorstep, turned his fat,
brown back upon the visitor, and became engrossed
in gnawing a big cabbage stalk. He was
afraid that if he should seem good-natured and
friendly, he might be called upon to show off some of
the tricks which MacPhairrson, with inexhaustible
patience, had taught him. He was not going to
turn somersaults, or roll over backward, or walk
like a dancing bear, for any Boy alive!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></p>
<p>This ill humour of Butters, however, attracted no
notice. It was accepted by both MacPhairrson and
his visitor as a thing of course. Moreover, there were
matters of more moment afoot. That lively, squirming
bag which the Boy carried so carefully in the
hollow of his left arm was exciting the old woodsman&#8217;s
curiosity. The lumbermen and mill hands, as
well as the farmer-folk of the Settlement for miles
about, were given to bringing MacPhairrson all kinds
of wild creatures as candidates for admission to his
Happy Family. So whenever any one came with
something alive in a bag, MacPhairrson would regard
the bag with that hopeful and eager anticipation
with which a child regards its Christmas stocking.</p>
<p>When the two had entered the cabin and seated
themselves, the Boy in the big barrel chair by the
window, and MacPhairrson on the edge of his bunk,
not three feet away, the rest of the company gathered
in a semicircle of expectation in the middle of the
floor. That is, Stumpy and Ebenezer and the two
white cats did so, their keen noses as well as their
inquisitive eyes having been busied about the bundle.
Even James Edward came a few steps inside the
door, and with a fine assumption of unconcern kept
himself in touch with the proceedings. Only Susan
was really indifferent, lying down outside the door&ndash;&ndash;Susan,
and that big bunch of fluffy brown feathers
on the barrel in the corner of the cabin.</p>
<p>The air fairly thrilled with expectation as the boy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
took the wriggling bag on his knee and started to
open it. The moment there was an opening, out
came a sharp little black nose pushing and twisting
eagerly for freedom. The nose was followed in an
instant by a pair of dark, intelligent, mischievous
eyes. Then a long-tailed young raccoon squirmed
forth, clambered up to the Boy&#8217;s shoulder, and
turned to eye the assemblage with bright defiance.
Never before in his young life had he seen such a
remarkable assemblage; which, after all, was not
strange, as there was surely not another like it in the
world.</p>
<p>The new-comer&#8217;s reception, on the whole, was not
unfriendly. The two white cats, to be sure, fluffed
their tails a little, drew back from the circle, and
went off to curl up in the sun and sleep off their aversion
to a stranger. James Edward, too, his curiosity
satisfied, haughtily withdrew. But Stumpy, as
acknowledged dean of the Family, wagged his tail,
hung out his pink tongue as far as it would go, and
panted a welcome so obvious that a much less intelligent
animal than the young raccoon could not have
failed to understand it. Ebenezer was less demonstrative,
but his little eyes twinkled with unmistakable
good-will. Ananias-and-Sapphira was extraordinarily
interested. In a tremendous hurry she
scrambled down MacPhairrson&#8217;s arm, down his
leg, across the floor, and up the Boy&#8217;s trousers. The
Boy was a little anxious.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Will she bite him?&#8221; he asked, preparing to defend
his pet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon she won&#8217;t,&#8221; answered MacPhairrson,
observing that the capricious bird&#8217;s plumage was not
ruffled, but pressed down so hard and smooth and
close to her body that she looked much less than her
usual size. &#8220;Generally she ain&#8217;t ugly when she
looks that way. But she&#8217;s powerful interested, I tell
you!&#8221;</p>
<p>The little raccoon was crouching on the Boy&#8217;s
right shoulder. Ananias-and-Sapphira, using beak
and claws, scrambled nimbly to the other shoulder.
Then, reaching far around past the Boy&#8217;s face, she
fixed the stranger piercingly with her unwinking
gaze, and emitted an ear-splitting shriek of laughter.
The little coon&#8217;s nerves were not prepared for such a
strain. In his panic he fairly tumbled from his perch
to the floor, and straightway fled for refuge to the
broad back of the surprised and flattered pig.</p>
<p>&#8220;The little critter&#8217;s all right!&#8221; declared MacPhairrson,
when he and the Boy were done laughing.
&#8220;Ananias-an&#8217;-Sapphira won&#8217;t hurt him. She likes
all the critters she kin bully an&#8217; skeer. An&#8217; Stumpy
an&#8217; that comical cuss of a Ebenezer, they be goin&#8217;
to look out fer him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></p>
<p style='text-align:center; margin:1em auto 1.5em auto;'>II</p>
<p>About a week after this admission of the little
raccoon to his Family, MacPhairrson met with an
accident. Coming down the long, sloping platform
of the mill, the point of one of his crutches caught
in a crack, and he plunged headlong, striking his head
on a link of heavy &#8220;snaking&#8221; chain. He was
picked up unconscious and carried to the nearest
cabin. For several days his stupor was unbroken,
and the doctor hardly expected him to pull through.
Then he recovered consciousness&ndash;&ndash;but he was no
longer MacPhairrson. His mind was a sort of
amiable blank. He had to be fed and cared for like a
very young child. The doctor decided at last that
there was some pressure of bone on the brain, and
that operations quite beyond his skill would be
required. At his suggestion a purse was made up
among the mill hands and the Settlement folk, and
MacPhairrson, smiling with infantile enjoyment, was
packed off down river on the little tri-weekly steamer
to the hospital in the city.</p>
<p>As soon as it was known around the mill&ndash;&ndash;which
stood amidst its shanties a little apart from the
Settlement&ndash;&ndash;that MacPhairrson was to be laid up
for a long time, the question arose: &#8220;What&#8217;s to become
of the Family?&#8221; It was morning when the
accident happened, and in the afternoon the Boy
had come up to look after the animals. After
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
that, when the mill stopped work at sundown, there
was a council held, amid the suddenly silent saws.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s to be done about the orphants?&#8221; was
the way Jimmy Wright put the problem.</p>
<p>Black Angus MacAllister, the Boss&ndash;&ndash;so called to
distinguish him from Red Angus, one of the gang of
log-drivers&ndash;&ndash;had his ideas already pretty well
formed on the subject, and intended that his ideas
should go. He did not really care much about any
one else&#8217;s ideas except the Boy&#8217;s, which he respected
as second only to those of MacPhairrson where the
wild kindreds were concerned. Black Angus was a
huge, big-handed, black-bearded, bull-voiced man,
whose orders and imprecations made themselves
heard above the most piercing crescendos of the saws.
When his intolerant eyes fixed a man, what he had
to say usually went, no matter what different views
on the subject his hearer might secretly cling to.
But he had a tender, somewhat sentimental streak
in his character, which expressed itself in a fondness
for all animals. The horses and oxen working
around the mill were all well cared for and showed it
in their condition; and the Boss was always ready
to beat a man half to death for some very slight ill-usage
of an animal.</p>
<p>&#8220;A man kin take keer o&#8217; himself,&#8221; he would say in
explanation, &#8220;an&#8217; the dumb critters can&#8217;t. It&#8217;s our
place to take keer of &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; said he, his great voice not yet toned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
down to the quiet, &#8220;I say, let&#8217;s divvy up the critters
among us, jest us mill hands an&#8217; the Boy here, an&#8217;
look out fer &#8217;em the best we know how till MacPhairrson
gits well!&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked interrogatively at the Boy, and the
Boy, proud of the importance thus attached to him,
answered modestly&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what I was hoping you&#8217;d suggest, Mr.
MacAllister. You know, of course, they can&#8217;t stay
on together there alone. They wouldn&#8217;t be a Happy
Family long. They&#8217;d get to fighting in no time,
and about half of &#8217;em would get killed quick.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a moment of deliberative silence. No
smoking was allowed in the mill, but the hands all
chewed. Jimmy Wright, marking the bright face of
a freshly sawed deal about eight feet away, spat
unerringly upon its exact centre, then giving a
hitch to his trousers, he remarked&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let the Boss an&#8217; the Boy settle it. They onderstand
it the best.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Jimmy! We&#8217;ll fix it!&#8221; said Black
Angus. &#8220;Now, for mine, I&#8217;ve got a fancy for the
parrot an&#8217; the pig. That there Ananias-and-Sapphira,
she&#8217;s a bird an&#8217; no mistake. An&#8217; the pig&ndash;&ndash;MacPhairrson
calls him Ebenezer&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;s that smart
ye&#8217;d jest kill yerself laffin&#8217; to see him. An&#8217;, moreover,
he&#8217;s that clean&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;s clean as a lady. I&#8217;d
like to have them two around my shanty. An&#8217; I&#8217;m
ready to take one more if necessary.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then I think you&#8217;ll have to take the coon too,
Mr. MacAllister,&#8221; said the Boy. &#8220;He and Ebenezer
just love each other, an&#8217; they wouldn&#8217;t be happy
separated.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. The coon fer me!&#8221; responded the
Boss. &#8220;Which of the critters will you take yerself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wait and see which the rest of the boys want,&#8221;
replied the Boy. &#8220;I like them all, and they all know
me pretty well. I&#8217;ll take what&#8217;s left.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; said Jimmy Wright, &#8220;me for
Susan. That blame moose calf&#8217;s the only one of the
critters that I could ever git along with. She&#8217;s a
kind of a fool, an&#8217; seems to like me!&#8221; And he decorated
the bright deal once more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me an&#8217; my missus, we&#8217;ll be proud to take them
two white cats!&#8221; put in grey old Billy Smith.
&#8220;She sez, sez she, they be the han&#8217;somest cats
in two counties. Mebbe they won&#8217;t be so lonesome
with us as they&#8217;d be somewheres else, bein&#8217;s as our
shanty&#8217;s so nigh MacPhairrson&#8217;s bridge they kin see
for themselves all the time there ain&#8217;t no one on to
the island any more!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stumpy&#8217;s not spoken for!&#8221; reminded the Boy.
The dog was popular, and half a dozen volunteered
for him at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mike gits the dawg!&#8221; decided the Boss, to head
off arguments.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll take the big gander,&#8221; spoke up Baldy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
Pallen, one of the disappointed applicants for
Stumpy. &#8220;He knows as much as any dawg ever
lived.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I reckon he kin teach ye a heap, Baldy!&#8221;
agreed the Boss. A laugh went round at Baldy&#8217;s
expense. Then for a few seconds there were no
more applications.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one seems to want poor Butters and Bones!&#8221;
laughed the Boy. &#8220;They&#8217;re neither of them what
you&#8217;d call sociable. But Bones has his good points.
He can see in the dark; and he&#8217;s a great one for
minding his own business. Butters has a heap of
sense; but he&#8217;s too cross to show it, except for MacPhairrson
himself. Guess <i>I&#8217;d</i> better take them both,
as I understand their infirmities.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; ain&#8217;t there a young fox?&#8221; inquired the
Boss.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Carrots; he can just stay on the island,&#8221;
answered the Boy. &#8220;If some of you&#8217;ll throw him a
bite to eat every day, he&#8217;ll be all right. He can&#8217;t get
into any mischief. And he can&#8217;t get away. He
stands on his dignity so, nobody&#8217;d get any fun out of
having <i>him!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>These points decided, the council broke up and
adjourned to MacPhairrson&#8217;s island, carrying several
pieces of rope, a halter, and a couple of oat-bags.
The members of the Family, vaguely upset over the
long absence of their master, nearly all came down
to the bridge in their curiosity to see who was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
coming&ndash;&ndash;all, indeed, but the fox, who slunk off behind the
cabin; Butters, who retired to his box; and Bones,
who remained scornfully indifferent in his corner.
The rest eyed the crowd uneasily, but were reassured
by seeing the Boy with them. In fact, they
all crowded around him, as close as they could, except
Stumpy, who went about greeting his acquaintances,
and James Edward, who drew back with lifted
wings and a haughty hiss, resolved to suffer no
familiarities.</p>
<p>Jimmy Wright made the first move. He had
cunningly brought some salt in his pocket. With
the casual remark that he wasn&#8217;t going to put it on
her tail, he offered a handful to the non-committal
Susan. The ungainly creature blew most of it
away with a windy snort, then changed her mind and
greedily licked up the few remaining grains. Deciding
that Jimmy was an agreeable person with
advantages, she allowed him to slip the halter on her
neck and lead her unprotesting over the bridge.</p>
<p>Then Black Angus made overtures to Ebenezer,
who carried the little raccoon on his back. Ebenezer
received them with a mixture of dignity and doubt,
but refused to stir an inch from the Boy&#8217;s side. Black
Angus scratched his head in perplexity.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t no use tryn&#8217; to lead him, I reckon!&#8221; he
muttered.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you&#8217;ll have to carry him in your arms, Mr.
MacAllister,&#8221; laughed the Boy. &#8220;Good thing he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
ain&#8217;t very big yet. But here, take Ananias-and-Sapphira
first. If <i>she&#8217;ll</i> be friends with you, that&#8217;ll
mean a lot to Ebenezer.&#8221; And he deftly transferred
the parrot from his own shoulder, where she had
taken refuge at once on his arrival, to the lofty shoulder
of the Boss.</p>
<p>The bird was disconcerted for an instant. She
&#8220;slicked&#8221; down her feathers till she looked small
and demure, and stretched herself far out as if to
try a jump for her old perch. But, one wing being
clipped, she did not dare the attempt. She had had
enough experience of those sickening, flopping
somersaults which took the place of flight when only
one wing was in commission. Turning from the
Boy, she eyed MacAllister&#8217;s nose with her evil, unwinking
stare. Possibly she intended to bite it.
But at this moment MacAllister reached up his huge
hand fearlessly to stroke her head, just as fearlessly
as if she were not armed with a beak that could
bite through a boot. Greatly impressed by this
daring, she gurgled in her throat, and took the great
thumb delicately between her mandibles with a
daintiness that would not have marred a rose-petal.
Yes, she concluded at once, this was a man after her
own heart, with a smell to his hands like that of MacPhairrson
himself. Dropping the thumb with a little
scream of satisfaction, she sidled briskly up and down
MacAllister&#8217;s shoulder, making herself quite at
home.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></p>
<p>&#8220;My, but she&#8217;s taken a shine to you, Mr. MacAllister!&#8221;
exclaimed the Boy. &#8220;I never saw her do like
that before.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Boss grinned proudly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ananias-an&#8217;-Sapphira be of the female sect,
bain&#8217;t she?&#8221; inquired Baldy Pallen, with a sly look
over the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, she&#8217;s a she!&#8221; replied the Boy. &#8220;MacPhairrson
says so!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That accounts fer it!&#8221; said Baldy. &#8220;It&#8217;s a way
all shes have with the Boss. Jest look at her now!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now for Ebenezer!&#8221; interrupted the Boss, to
change the subject. &#8220;<i>You</i> better hand him to me,
an&#8217; maybe he&#8217;ll take it as an introduction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Solemnly the Boy stooped, shoving the little
raccoon aside, and picked the pig up in his arms.
Ebenezer was amazed, having never before been
treated as a lap-dog, but he made no resistance beyond
stiffening out all his legs in a way that made
him most awkward to handle. Placed in the Boss&#8217;s
great arms, he lifted his snout straight up in the
air and emitted one shrill squeal; but the sight of
Ananias-and-Sapphira, perched coolly beneath his
captor&#8217;s ear, in a measure reassured him, and he
made no further protest. He could not, however,
appear reconciled to the inexplicable and altogether
undignified situation, so he held his snout rigidly as
high aloft as he could and shut his little eyes tight,
as if anticipating some further stroke of fate.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></p>
<p>Black Angus was satisfied so far. He felt that the
tolerance of Ebenezer and the acceptance of Ananias-and-Sapphira
added distinctly to his prestige.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now for the little coon!&#8221; said he, jocularly.
But the words were hardly out of his mouth when
he felt sharp claws go up his leg with a rush, and the
next instant the little raccoon was on his shoulder,
reaching out its long, black nose to sniff solicitously
at Ebenezer&#8217;s legs and assure itself that everything
was all right.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jumping Jiminy! Oh, by Gee!&#8221; squealed Ananias-and-Sapphira,
startled at the sudden onset,
and nipped the intruder smartly on the leg till he
squalled and whipped around to the other shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;ve got all that&#8217;s coming to you, I guess,
Mr. MacAllister,&#8221; laughed the Boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I reckon I&#8217;d better be lightin&#8217; out fer home
with it!&#8221; answered Black Angus, hugely elated.
Turning gently, so as not to dislodge the passengers
on his shoulder, he strode off over the bridge and up
the sawdust-muffled street towards his clapboard
cottage, Ebenezer&#8217;s snout still held rigidly up in air,
his eyes shut in heroic resignation, while Ananias-and-Sapphira,
tremendously excited by this excursion
into the outer world, kept shrieking at the top of
her voice: &#8220;Ebenezer, Ebenezer, Ebenezer! Oh, by
Gee! I want Pa!&#8221;</p>
<p>As soon as the noisy and picturesque recessional of
Black Angus had vanished, Baldy Pallen set out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
confidently to capture the wild gander, James
Edward. He seemed to expect to tuck him under
his arm and walk off with him at his ease. Observing
this, the Boy looked around with a solemn wink.
Old Billy Smith and the half-dozen onlookers who
had no responsibility in the affair grinned and
waited. As Baldy approached, holding out a hand
of placation, and &#8220;chucking&#8221; persuasively as if he
thought James Edward was a hen, the latter reared
his snaky black head and stared in haughty surprise.
Then he gave vent to a strident hiss of
warning. Could it be possible that this impudent
stranger contemplated meddling with him? Yes,
plainly it was possible. It was certain, in fact.
The instant he realized this, James Edward lowered
his long neck, darted it out parallel with the ground,
spread his splendid wings, and rushed at Baldy&#8217;s
legs with a hiss like escaping steam. Baldy was
startled and bewildered. His legs tweaked savagely
by the bird&#8217;s strong, hard bill, and thumped painfully
by the great, battering, windy wings, he sputtered:
&#8220;Jumpin&#8217; Judas!&#8221; in an embarrassed tone,
and retreated behind Billy Smith and the Boy.</p>
<p>A roar of delighted laughter arose as James
Edward backed away in haughty triumph, and
strolled carelessly up towards the cabin. There
were cries of &#8220;Ketch him quick, Baldy!&#8221; &#8220;Try a
leetle coaxin&#8217;!&#8221; &#8220;Don&#8217;t be so rough with the
gosling, Baldy!&#8221; &#8220;Jest whistle to him, an&#8217; he&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
folly ye!&#8221; But, ignoring these pleasantries, Baldy
rubbed his legs and turned to the Boy for guidance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure you want him now?&#8221; inquired the
latter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Course I want him!&#8221; returned Baldy with a
sheepish grin. &#8220;I&#8217;ll coax him round an&#8217; make friends
with him all right when I git him home. But how&#8217;m
I goin&#8217; to git him? I&#8217;m afeared o&#8217; hurtin&#8217; him, he
seems that delicate, and his feelin&#8217;s so sensitive
like!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to surround him, kind of. Just
wait, boys!&#8221; said the Boy. And running into the
cabin, past the deliberate James Edward, he reappeared
with a heavy blanket.</p>
<p>The great gander eyed his approach with contemptuous
indifference. He had come to regard the
Boy as quite harmless. When, therefore, the encumbering
folds of the blanket descended, it was
too late to resist. In a moment he was rolled over in
the dark, bundled securely, picked up, and ignominiously
tucked under Baldy Pallen&#8217;s arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;ve got him, don&#8217;t let go o&#8217; him!&#8221;
admonished the Boy, and amid encouraging jeers
Baldy departed, carrying the bundle victoriously.
He had not more than crossed the bridge, however,
when the watchers on the island saw a slender black
head wriggle out from one end of the bundle, dart
upward behind his left arm, and seize the man
viciously by the ear. With a yell Baldy grabbed the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
head, and held it securely in his great fist till the
Boy ran to his rescue. When James Edward&#8217;s bill
was removed from Baldy&#8217;s bleeding ear, his darting,
furious head tucked back into the blanket, the Boy
said&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Baldy, that was just your own fault for
not keeping tight hold. You can&#8217;t blame James
Edward for biting you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, no!&#8221; responded Baldy, cheerfully. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t blame him a mite. I brag on the spunk of him.
Him an&#8217; me&#8217;ll git on all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>James Edward gone, the excitement was over.
The Boy picked up the two big white cats, Melindy
and Jim, and placed them in the arms of old Billy
Smith, where they settled themselves, looking about
with an air of sleepy wisdom. From smallest kittenhood
the smell of a homespun shirt had stood to
them for every kind of gentleness and shelter, so
they saw no reason to find fault with the arms of
Billy Smith. By this time old Butters, the woodchuck,
disturbed at the scattering of the Family, had
retired in a huff to the depths of his little barrel by
the doorstep. The Boy clapped an oat-bag over the
end of the barrel, and tied it down. Then he went
into the cabin and slipped another bag over the head
of the unsuspecting Bones, who fluffed all his feathers
and snapped his fierce beak like castanets. In two
minutes he was tied up so that he could neither bite
nor claw.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That was slick!&#8221; remarked Red Angus, who
had hitherto taken no part in the proceedings. He
and the rest of the hands had followed in hope of
further excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, Angus, will you help me home? Will
you take the barrel, and see that Butters doesn&#8217;t gnaw
out on the way?&#8221;</p>
<p>Red Angus picked up the barrel and carried it
carefully in front of him, head up, that the sly old
woodchuck might not steal a march on him. Then
the Boy picked up Bones in his oat-bag, and closed
the cabin door. As the party left the island with
loud tramping of feet on the little bridge, the young
fox crept slyly from behind the cabin, and eyed them
through cunningly narrowed slits of eyes. At last
he was going to have the island all to himself; and
he set himself to dig a burrow directly under the
doorstep, where that meddlesome MacPhairrson had
never permitted him to dig.</p>
<p style='text-align:center; margin:1em auto 1.5em auto;'>III</p>
<p>It was in the green zenith of June when MacPhairrson
went away. When he returned, hobbling up
with his tiny bundle, the backwoods world was
rioting in the scarlet and gold of young October.
He was quite cured. He felt singularly well. But
a desperate loneliness saddened his home-coming.
He knew his cabin would be just as he had left it,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
there on its steep little foam-ringed island; and he
knew the Boy would be there, with the key, to admit
him over the bridge and welcome him home. But
what would the island be without the Family?
The Boy, doubtless, had done what he could.
He had probably taken care of Stumpy, and perhaps
of Ananias-and-Sapphira. But the rest of
the Family must inevitably be scattered to the
four winds. Tears came into his eyes as he thought
of himself and Stumpy and the parrot, the poor
lonely three, there amid the sleepless clamour of the
rapids, lamenting their vanished comrades. A chill
that was more than the approaching autumn twilight
could account for settled upon his heart.</p>
<p>Arriving at the little bridge, however, his heart
warmed again, for there was the Boy waving at him,
and hurrying down to the gate to let him in. And
there at the Boy&#8217;s heels was Stumpy, sure enough.
MacPhairrson shouted, and Stumpy, at the sound
of the loud voice, went wild, trying to tear his way
through the gate. When the gate opened, he had
to brace himself against the frame, before he could
grasp the Boy&#8217;s hand, so extravagant and overwhelming
were the yelping Stumpy&#8217;s caresses.
Gladly he suffered them, letting the excited dog
lick his hands and even his face; for, after all,
Stumpy was the best and dearest member of the
Family. Then, to steady him, he gave him his
bundle to carry up to the cabin, and proudly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
Stumpy trotted on ahead with it. MacPhairrson&#8217;s
voice trembled as he tried to thank the Boy for
bringing Stumpy back to him&ndash;&ndash;trembled and
choked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help it!&#8221; he explained apologetically as
soon as he got his voice again. &#8220;I love Stumpy
best, of course! You kept the best fer me! But,
Jiminy Christmas, Boy, how I miss the rest on
&#8217;em!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t keep Stumpy!&#8221; explained the Boy
as the two went up the path. &#8220;It was Mike
Sweeny took care of him for you. He brought him
round this morning because he had to get off to the
woods cruising. I took care of Bones&ndash;&ndash;we&#8217;ll find
him on his box inside&ndash;&ndash;and of cross old Butters.
Thunder, how Butters has missed you, MacPhairrson!
He&#8217;s bit me twice, just because I wasn&#8217;t you. There
he is, poking his nose out of his barrel.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old woodchuck thought he had heard
MacPhairrson&#8217;s voice, but he was not sure. He
came out and sat up on his fat haunches,
his nostrils quivering with expectation. Then he
caught sight of the familiar limping form. With
a little squeal of joy he scurried forward and fell to
clutching and clawing at his master&#8217;s legs till MacPhairrson
picked him up. Whereupon he expressed
his delight by striving to crowd his nose into MacPhairrson&#8217;s
neck. At this moment the fox appeared
from hiding behind the cabin, and sat up, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
ears cocked shrewdly and head to one side, to take
note of his master&#8217;s return.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord, how Carrots has growed!&#8221; exclaimed
MacPhairrson, lovingly, and called him to come.
But the fox yawned in his face, got up lazily, and
trotted off to the other side of the island. MacPhairrson&#8217;s
face fell.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got no kind of a heart at all,&#8221; said the Boy,
soothing his disappointment.</p>
<p>&#8220;He ain&#8217;t no use to nobody,&#8221; said MacPhairrson.
&#8220;I reckon we&#8217;d better let him go.&#8221; Then he hobbled
into the cabin to greet Bones, who ruffled up his
feathers at his approach, but recognized him and
submitted to being stroked.</p>
<p>Presently MacPhairrson straightened up on his
crutches, turned, and gulped down a lump in his
throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon we&#8217;ll be mighty contented here,&#8221; said
he, &#8220;me an&#8217; Stumpy, an&#8217; Butters, an&#8217; Bones. But
I <i>wisht</i> as how I might git to have Ananias-an&#8217;-Sapphira
back along with us. I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to miss that there
bird a lot, fer all she was so ridiculous an&#8217; cantankerous.
I s&#8217;pose, now, you don&#8217;t happen to know who&#8217;s got
her, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know she&#8217;s got a good home!&#8221; answered the
Boy, truthfully. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t know that I could
tell you just where she is!&#8221;</p>
<p>At just this minute, however, there came a jangling
of the gate bell, and screeches of&ndash;&ndash;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, by Gee! Jumpin&#8217; Jiminy! Oh, Boy! I
want Pa!&#8221;</p>
<p>MacPhairrson&#8217;s gaunt and grizzled face grew
radiant. Nimbly he hobbled to the door, to see the
Boy already on the bridge, opening the gate. To
his amazement, in strode Black Angus the Boss,
with the bright green glitter of Ananias-and-Sapphira
on his shoulder screeching varied profanities&ndash;&ndash;and
whom at his heels but Ebenezer and the little ring-tailed
raccoon. In his excitement the old woodsman
dropped one of his crutches. Therefore, instead
of going to meet his visitors, he plumped down
on the bench outside his door and just waited. A
moment later the quaint procession arrived. MacPhairrson
found Black Angus shaking him hugely by
the hand, Ebenezer, much grown up, rooting at his
knees with a happy little squeal, and Ananias-and-Sapphira,
as of old, clambering excitedly up his
shirt-front.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, there, easy now, old pard,&#8221; he murmured
to the pig, fondling the animal&#8217;s ears with one hand,
while he gave the other to the bird, to be nibbled
and nipped ecstatically, the raccoon meanwhile looking
on with bright-eyed, non-committal interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Angus,&#8221; said the old woodsman presently, by
way of an attempt at thanks, &#8220;ye&#8217;re a wonderful
hand with the dumb critters&ndash;&ndash;not that one could
rightly call Ananias-an&#8217;-Sapphira dumb, o&#8217; course&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;n&#8217;
I swear <i>I</i> couldn&#8217;t never have kep&#8217; &#8217;em
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
lookin&#8217; so fine and slick all through the summer. I
reckon&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But he never finished that reckoning. Down to
his bridge was coming another and a larger procession
than that of Black Angus. First, and even now
entering through the gate, he saw Jimmy Wright
leading a lank young moose cow, whom he recognized
as Susan. Close behind was old Billy Smith with
the two white cats, Melindy and Jim, in his arms;
and then Baldy Fallen, with a long blanket bundle
under his arm. Behind them came the rest of the
mill hands, their faces beaming welcome. MacPhairrson,
shaking all over, with big tears in his
eyes, reached for his fallen crutch and stood up.
When the visitors arrived and gave him their hearty
greetings, he could find no words to answer. Baldy
laid his bundle gently on the ground and respectfully
unrolled it. Out stepped the lordly James Edward
and lifted head and wings with a troubled <i>honk-a,
honka.</i> As soon as he saw MacPhairrson, he came up
and stood close beside him, which was as much enthusiasm
as the haughty gander could bring himself
to show. The cats meanwhile were rubbing and
purring against their old master&#8217;s legs, while Susan
sniffed at him with a noisy, approving snort. MacPhairrson&#8217;s
throat, and then his whole face, began to
work. How different was this home-coming from
what he had expected! Here, wonder of wonders,
was his beloved Family all gathered about him!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
How good the boys were! He must try to thank
them all. Bracing himself with one crutch, he
strove to express to them his immeasurable gratitude
and gladness. In vain, for some seconds, he struggled
to down the lump in his throat. Then, with a
titanic effort, he blurted out: &#8220;Oh, hell, boys!&#8221;
and sat down, and hid his wet eyes in Stumpy&#8217;s shaggy
hair.</p>

</div>
<p>It was no doubt partly pride, in having for once
succeeded in evading her grandmother&#8217;s all-seeing
eye, that enabled Mandy Ann to carry, at a trot, a
basket almost as big as herself&ndash;&ndash;to carry it all the way
down the hill to the river, without once stumbling or
stopping to take breath. The basket was not only
large, but uneasy, seeming to be troubled by internal
convulsions, which made it tip and lurch in a way that
from time to time threatened to upset Mandy Ann&#8217;s
unstable equilibrium. But being a young person of
character, she kept right on, ignoring the fact that
the stones on the shore were very sharp to her little
bare feet.</p>
<p>At last she reached the sunshiny cove, with shoals
of minnows flickering about its amber shallows, which
was the goal of her flight. Here, tethered to a stake
on the bank, lay the high-sided old bateau, which
Mandy Ann had long coveted as a perfectly ideal
play-house. Its high prow lightly aground, its stern
afloat, it swung lazily in the occasional puffs of lazy
air. Mandy Ann was only four years old, and her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
red cotton skirt just came to her dimpled grimy
little knees, but with that unfailing instinct of her
sex she gathered up the skirt and clutched it securely
between her breast and the rim of the basket. Then
she stepped into the water, waded to the edge of the
old bateau and climbed aboard.</p>
<p>The old craft was quite dry inside, and filled with
a clean pungent scent of warm tar. Mandy Ann
shook out her red skirt and her yellow curls, and
set down the big covered basket on the bottom of
the bateau. The basket continued to move tempestuously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, naughty! naughty!&#8221; she exclaimed, shaking
her chubby finger at it. &#8220;Jest a minute, jest a
teenty minute, an&#8217; we&#8217;ll see!&#8221;</p>
<p>Peering over the bow, Mandy Ann satisfied herself
that the bateau, though its bottom grated on the
pebbles, was completely surrounded by water. Then
sitting down on the bottom, she assured herself that
she was hidden by the boat&#8217;s high flaring sides from
the sight of all interfering domestic eyes on shore.
She felt sure that even the eyes of her grandmother,
in the little grey cottage back on the green hill, could
not reach her in this unguessed retreat. With a sigh
of unutterable content she made her way back into
the extreme stern of the bateau, lugging the tempestuous
basket with her. Sitting down flat, she
took the basket in her lap and loosened the cover,
crooning softly as she did so. Instantly a whiskered,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
brown snub-nose, sniffing and twitching with interrogation,
appeared at the edge. A round brown
head, with little round ears and fearless bright dark
eyes, immediately popped over the edge. With a
squeak of satisfaction a fat young woodchuck, nearly
full-grown, clambered forth and ran up on Mandy
Ann&#8217;s shoulder. The bateau, under the influence
of the sudden weight in the stern, floated clear of
the gravel and swung softly at the end of its rope.</p>
<p>Observing that the bateau was afloat, Mandy Ann
was delighted. She felt doubly secure, now, from
pursuit. Pulling a muddy carrot from her pocket
she held it up to the woodchuck, which was nuzzling
affectionately at her curls. But the smell of
the fresh earth reminded the little animal of something
which he loved even better than Mandy Ann&ndash;&ndash;even
better, indeed, than a juicy carrot. He longed
to get away, for a little while, from the loving but
sometimes too assiduous attention with which his
little mistress surrounded him&ndash;&ndash;to get away and
burrow to his heart&#8217;s content in the cool brown
earth, full of grass-roots. Ignoring the carrot, he
clambered down in his soft, loose-jointed fashion,
from Mandy Ann&#8217;s shoulder, and ran along the gunwale
to the bow. When he saw that he could not
reach shore without getting into the water, which he
loathed, he grumbled squeakingly, and kept bobbing
his round head up and down, as if he contemplated
making a jump for it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></p>
<p>At these symptoms Mandy Ann, who had been
eyeing him, called to him severely. &#8220;Naughty!&#8221;
she cried. &#8220;Come back this very instant, sir! You&#8217;d
jes&#8217; go an&#8217; tell Granny on me! Come right back
to your muzzer this instant!&#8221; At the sound of her
voice the little animal seemed to think better of his
rashness. The flashing and rippling of the water
daunted him. He returned to Mandy Ann&#8217;s side
and fell to gnawing philosophically at the carrot which
she thrust under his nose.</p>
<p>This care removed, Mandy Ann took an irregular
bundle out of the basket. It was tied up in a blue-and-white
handkerchief. Untying it with extreme
care, as if the contents were peculiarly precious, she
displayed a collection of fragments of many-coloured
glass and gay-painted china. Gloating happily over
these treasures, which flashed like jewels in the sun,
she began to sort them out and arrange them with
care along the nearest thwart of the bateau. Mandy
Ann was making what the children of the Settlement
knew and esteemed as a &#8220;Chaney House.&#8221; There
was keen rivalry among the children as to both location
and furnishing of these admired creations; and
to Mandy Ann&#8217;s daring imagination it had appeared
that a &#8220;Chaney House&#8221; in the old bateau would be
something surpassing dreams.</p>
<p>For an hour or more Mandy Ann was utterly absorbed
in her enchanting task. So quiet she was
over it that every now and then a yellow-bird or a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
fly-catcher would alight upon the edge of the bateau
to bounce away again with a startled and indignant
twitter. The woodchuck, having eaten his carrot,
curled up in the sun and went to sleep.</p>
<p>Mandy Ann&#8217;s collection was really a rich assortment
of colour. Every piece in it was a treasure in
her eyes. But much as she loved the bits of painted
china, she loved the glass better. There were red
bits, and green of many shades, and blue, yellow,
amber, purple and opal. Each piece, before arranging
it in its allotted place on the thwart, she would
lift to her eyes and survey the world through it.
Some near treetops, and the blue sky piled with
white fleeces of summer clouds, were all of the
world she could see from her retreat; but viewed
through different bits of glass these took on an infinite
variety of wonder and delight. So engrossed
she was, it quite escaped her notice that the old bateau
was less steady in its movements than it had been
when first she boarded it. She did not even observe
the fact that there were no longer any treetops in her
fairy-tinted pictures. At last there sounded under
the keel a strange gurgle, and the bateau gave a
swinging lurch which sent half the treasures of the
&#8220;Chaney House&#8221; clattering upon the bottom or into
Mandy Ann&#8217;s lap. The woodchuck woke up frightened
and scrambled into the shelter of its mistress&#8217;s
arms.</p>
<p>Much surprised, Mandy Ann knelt upright and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
looked out over the edge of the bateau. She was no
longer in the little sheltered cove, but far out on the
river. The shores, slipping smoothly and swiftly past,
looked unfamiliar to her. Where she expected to
see the scattered cottages of the Settlement, a huge
bank covered with trees, cut off the view. While
she was so engrossed with her coloured glass, a puff of
wind, catching the high sides of the bateau, had caused
it to tug at its tether. The rope, carelessly fastened
by some impatient boy, had slipped its hold; and the
bateau had been swept smoothly out into the hurrying
current. Half a mile below, the river rounded a
woody point, and the drifting bateau was hidden
from the sight of any one who might have hurried to
recover it.</p>
<p>At the moment, Mandy Ann was not frightened.
Her blue eyes danced with excitement as she tossed
back her tousled curls. The river, flowing swiftly
but smoothly, flashed and rippled in the noon sun
in a friendly fashion, and it was most interesting
to see how fast the shores slipped by. There was
no suggestion of danger; and probably, at the back
of her little brain, Mandy Ann felt that the beautiful
river, which she had always loved and never been
allowed to play with, would bring her back to her
Granny as gently and unexpectedly as it had carried
her away. Meanwhile, she felt only the thrilling
and utterly novel excitement of the situation. As
the bateau swung in an occasional oily eddy she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
laughed gaily at the motion, and felt as proud as
if she were doing it herself. And the woodchuck,
which had been very nervous at first, feeling that
something was wrong, was so reassured by its mistress&#8217;s
evident satisfaction that it curled up again on
the bottom and hastened to resume its slumber.</p>
<p>In a little while the river curved again, sweeping
back to its original course. Suddenly, in the distance,
the bright spire of the Settlement church
came into view, and then the familiar cottages.
Mandy Ann&#8217;s laughing face grew grave, as she saw
how very, very far away they looked. They took
on, also, from the distance, a certain strangeness
which smote her heart. This wonderful adventure
of hers ceased to have any charm for her. She
wanted to go back at once. Then her grandmother&#8217;s
little grey house on the slope came into view. Oh,
how terribly little and queer and far away it looked.
And it was getting farther and farther away every
minute. A frightened cry of &#8220;Granny! Granny!
Take me home!&#8221; broke from her lips. She stood
up, and made her way hurriedly to the other end of
the bateau, which, being upstream, was nearer home.
As her weight reached the bow, putting it deeper
into the grip of the current, the bateau slowly swung
around till it headed the other way. Mandy Ann
turned and hurried again to the point nearest home.
Whereupon the bateau calmly repeated its disconcerting
man&oelig;uvre. All at once the whole truth of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
the situation burst upon Mandy Ann&#8217;s comprehension.
She was lost. She was being carried
away so far that she would never, never get back.
She was being swept out into the terrible wilds that
she had heard stories about. Her knees gave away
in her terror. Crouching, a little red tumbled heap,
on the bottom of the bateau, she lifted up her voice
in shrill wailings, which so frightened the woodchuck
that he came and crept under her skirt.</p>
<p>Below the Settlement the river ran for miles through
a country of ever-deepening desolation, without
cabin or clearing near its shores, till it emptied itself
into the yet more desolate lake known as &#8220;Big
Lonely,&#8221; a body of forsaken water about ten miles
long, surrounded by swamps and burnt-lands. From
the foot of Big Lonely the river raged away over a
mile of thundering ledges, through a chasm known
to the lumbermen as &#8220;The Devil&#8217;s Trough.&#8221; The
fury of this madness having spent itself between the
black walls of the canyon, the river continued rather
sluggishly its long course toward the sea. A few
miles below the Settlement the river began to get
hurried and turbulent, chafing white through rocky
rapids. When the bateau plunged into the first of
these, Mandy Ann&#8217;s wailing and sobbing stopped
abruptly. The clamour of the white waves and the
sight of their lashing wrath fairly stupefied her.
She sat up on the middle thwart, with the shivering
woodchuck clutched to her breast, and stared about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
with wild eyes. On every side the waves leaped up,
black, white, and amber, jumping at the staggering
bateau. But appalling as they looked to Mandy
Ann, they were not particularly dangerous to the
sturdy, high-sided craft which carried her. The old
bateau had been built to navigate just such waters.
Nothing could upset it, and on account of its high,
flaring sides, no ordinary rapids could swamp it.
It rode the loud chutes triumphantly, now dipping
its lofty nose, now bumping and reeling, but always
making the passage without serious mishap. All
through the rapids Mandy Ann would sit silent,
motionless, fascinated with horror. But in the long,
comparatively smooth reaches she would recover
herself enough to cry softly upon the woodchuck&#8217;s
soft brown fur, till that prudent little animal, exasperated
at the damp of her caresses, wriggled away
and crawled into his hated basket.</p>
<p>At last, when the bateau had run a dozen of these
noisy &#8220;rips,&#8221; Mandy Ann grew surfeited with terror,
and thought to comfort herself. Sitting down again
upon the bottom of the bateau, she sadly sought to
revive her interest in the &#8220;Chaney House.&#8221; She
would finger the choicest bits of painted porcelain,
and tell herself how pretty they were. She would
choose a fragment of scarlet or purple glass, hold it
up to her pathetic, tear-stained face, and try to interest
herself in the coloured landscape that filed by.
But it was no use. Even the amber glass had lost
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
its power to interest her. And at length, exhausted
by her terror and her loneliness, she sank down and
fell asleep.</p>
<p>It was late afternoon when Mandy Ann fell asleep,
and her sleep was the heavy semi-torpor coming after
unrelieved grief and fear. It was unjarred by the
pitching of the fiercer rapids which the bateau
presently encountered. The last mile of the river&#8217;s
course before joining the lake consisted of deep,
smooth &#8220;dead-water&#8221;; but, a strong wind from
the north-west having sprung up toward the end of
the day, the bateau drove on with undiminished
speed. On the edge of the evening, when the sun
was just sinking into the naked tops of the rampikes
along the western shore, the bateau swept out upon
the desolate reaches of Big Lonely, and in the clutch
of the wind hastened down mid-lake to seek the roaring
chutes and shrieking vortices of the &#8220;Devil&#8217;s
Trough.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Out in the middle of the lake, where the heavy
wind had full sweep, the pitching and thumping of
the big waves terrified the poor little woodchuck
almost to madness; but they made no impression on
the wearied child, where she lay sobbing tremulously
in her sleep. They made a great impression,
however, on a light birch canoe, which was creeping
up alongshore in the teeth of the wind, urged by
two paddles. The paddlers were a couple of lumbermen,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
returning from the mouth of the river. All
the spring and early summer they had been away
from the Settlement, working on &#8220;the drive&#8221; of
the winter&#8217;s logging, and now, hungry for home,
they were fighting their way doggedly against wind
and wave. There was hardly a decent camping-ground
on all the swamp-cursed shores of Big
Lonely, except at the very head of the lake, where
the river came in, and this spot the voyagers were
determined to make before dark. They would then
have clear poling ahead of them next day, to get
them home to the Settlement in time for supper.</p>
<p>The man in the bow, a black-bearded, sturdy
figure in a red shirt, paddled with slow, unvarying
strokes, dipping his big maple paddle deep and
bending his back to it, paying no heed whatever
to the heavy black waves which lurched at him
every other second and threatened to overwhelm the
bow of his frail craft. He had none of the responsibility.
His part was simply to supply power,
steady, unwavering power, to make head against
the relentless wind. The man in the stern, on the
other hand, had to think and watch and meet every
assault, as well as thrust the canoe forward into the
tumult. He was a gaunt, long-armed young giant,
bareheaded, with shaggy brown hair blown back
from his red-tanned face. His keen grey eyes noted
and measured every capricious lake-wave as it lunged
at him, and his wrist, cunning and powerful, delicately
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
varied each stroke to meet each instant&#8217;s
need. It was not enough that the canoe should be
kept from broaching-to and swamping or upsetting.
He was anxious that it should not ship water, and
wet certain treasures which they were taking home
to the backwoods from the shops of the little city
down by the sea. And while his eyes seemed to be
so engrossingly occupied in the battle with the waves
of Big Lonely, they were all the time refreshing themselves
with a vision&ndash;&ndash;the vision of a grey house on a
sunny hill-top, where his mother was waiting for
him, and where a little yellow-haired girl would
scream &#8220;<i>Dad</i>die, oh, Dad<i>die</i>!&#8221; when she saw him
coming up the road.</p>
<p>The dogged voyagers were within perhaps two miles
of the head of the lake, with the sun gone down behind
the desolate rampikes, and strange tints of
violet and rose and amber, beautiful and lonely,
touching the angry turbulence of the waves, when the
man in the bow, whose eyes were free to wander,
caught sight of the drifting bateau. It was a little
ahead of them, but farther out in the lake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t that old Joe&#8217;s bateau out yonder, Chris?&#8221;
he queried, his trained woodsman&#8217;s eye recognizing
the craft by some minute detail of build or blemish.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon it be!&#8221; answered Chris, after a moment&#8217;s
scrutiny. &#8220;He&#8217;s let her git adrift. Water
must be raisin&#8217; sudden!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll be a fine quality o&#8217; kindlin&#8217; wood in another
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
hour, the rate she&#8217;s travelling&#8221; commented the other
with mild interest. But the young giant in the stern
was more concerned. He was sorry that old Joe
should lose his boat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Darned old fool, not to tie her!&#8221; he growled.
&#8220;Ef &#8217;twarn&#8217;t fer this wind ag&#8217;in&#8217; us, we could ketch
it an&#8217; tow it ashore fer him. But we can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t stop fer it ef &#8217;t had a bag o&#8217; gold
into it!&#8221; grunted the other, slogging on his paddle
with renewed vigour as he looked forward to the
camp-ground still so far ahead. He was hungry
and tired, and couldn&#8217;t even take time to fill his pipe
in that hurly-burly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the bateau had swept down swiftly,
and passed them at a distance of not more than a
hundred yards. It was with a qualm of regret that
Chris saw it go by, to be ground to splinters in the
yelling madness of the Devil&#8217;s Trough. After it
had passed, riding the waves bravely like the good
old craft that it was, he glanced back after it in half-humorous
regret. As he did so, his eye caught
something that made him look again. A little
furry brown creature was peering over the gunwale
at the canoe. The gunwale tipped toward him at
that instant and he saw it distinctly. Yes, it was
a woodchuck, and no mistake. And it seemed to
be making mute appeal to him to come and save it
from a dreadful doom. Chris hesitated, looking
doubtfully at his companion&#8217;s heaving back. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
looked an unresponsive back. Moreover, Chris
felt half ashamed of his own compassionate impulse.
He knew that he was considered foolishly softhearted
about animals and children and women,
though few men cared to express such an opinion
to him too frankly. He suspected that, in the
present case, his companion would have a right to
complain of him. But he could not stand the idea
of letting the little beast&ndash;&ndash;which had so evidently
appealed to him for succour&ndash;&ndash;go down into the
horrors of the Devil&#8217;s Trough. His mind was made
up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mart,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to turn.
There&#8217;s somethin&#8217; aboard that there old bateau
that I want.&#8221; And he put the head of the canoe
straight up into a big wave.</p>
<p>&#8220;The devil there is!&#8221; cried the other, taking
in his paddle and looking around in angry protest.
&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Paddle, ye loon! Paddle hard!&#8221; ordered
Chris. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell ye when we git her &#8217;round.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus commanded, and the man at the stern paddle
being supreme in a canoe, the backwoodsman
obeyed with a curse. It was no time to argue, while
getting the canoe around in that sea. But as soon as
the canoe was turned, and scudding with frightened
swoops down the waves in pursuit of the fleeing
bateau, he saw, and understood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Confound you, Chris McKeen, if &#8217;tain&#8217;t nothin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
but a blankety blank woodchuck!&#8221; he shouted,
making as if to back water and try to turn the
canoe again.</p>
<p>Chris&#8217;s grey eyes hardened. &#8220;Look a&#8217; here, Mart
Babcock,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;don&#8217;t you be up to no
foolishness. Ye kin cuss all ye like&ndash;&ndash;but either
paddle as I tell ye or take in yer paddle an&#8217; set quiet.
<i>I&#8217;m</i> runnin&#8217; this &#8217;ere canoe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Babcock took in his paddle, cursing bitterly.</p>
<p>&#8220;A woodchuck! A measly woodchuck!&#8221; he
shouted, with unutterable contempt expressed in
every word. &#8220;I know&#8217;d ye was a fool, Chris McKeen,
but I didn&#8217;t know ye was so many kinds of a mush-head
of a fool!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Course it&#8217;s a woodchuck!&#8221; agreed Chris, surging
on his paddle. &#8220;Do ye think I&#8217;d let the leetle
critter go down the &#8216;Trough,&#8217; jest so&#8217;s ye could git
your bacon an&#8217; tea an hour sooner? I always did
like woodchucks, anyways.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take it out o&#8217; yer hide fer this when we git
ashore; you wait!&#8221; stormed Babcock, courageously.
He knew it would be some time before they could get
ashore, and so he would have a chance to forget his
threat.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, Mart!&#8221; assented McKeen.
&#8220;My hide&#8217;ll be all here waitin&#8217; on ye. But fer now

of the leetle critter. I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to take it home for
Mandy Ann.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the canoe swept down upon the swooping and
staggering bateau, Babcock put out his paddle in
readiness to fend or catch as he might be directed.
A moment later Chris ran the canoe past and brought
her up dexterously under the lee of the high-walled
craft. Babcock caught her with a firm grip, at the
same time holding her off with the paddle, and
glanced in, while Chris&#8217;s eyes were still occupied.
His dark face went white as cotton.</p>
<p>&#8220;My God, Chris! Forgive me! I didn&#8217;t know!&#8221;
he groaned.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;Mandy Ann!&#8221; exclaimed her father, in a
hushed voice, climbing into the bateau and catching
the child into his arms.</p>

<h2><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>From Buck to Bear and Back</span></h2>
</div>
<p>The sunny, weather-beaten, comfortable little
house, with its grey sheds and low grey barn
half enclosing its bright, untidy farmyard, stood
on the top of the open hill, where every sweet forest
wind could blow over it night and day.</p>
<p>Fields of oats, buckwheat, and potatoes came up
all about it over the slopes of the hill; and its only
garden was a spacious patch of cabbages and &#8220;garden
sass&#8221; three or four hundred yards down
toward the edge of the forest, where a pocket of rich
black loam had specially invited an experiment in
horticulture.</p>
<p>Like most backwoods farmers, Sam Coxen had
been wont to look with large scorn on such petty
interests as gardening; but a county show down
at the Settlement had converted him, and now
his cabbage patch was the chief object of his solicitude.
He had proud dreams of prizes to be won at
the next show&ndash;&ndash;now not three weeks ahead.</p>
<p>It was his habit, whenever he harnessed up the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
team for a drive into the Settlement, to turn his head
the last thing before leaving and cast a long,
gratified look down over the cabbage patch, its
cool, clear green standing out sharply against the
yellow-brown of the surrounding fields. On this
particular morning he did not turn for that look
till he had jumped into the wagon and gathered up
the reins. Then, as he gazed, a wave of indignation
passed over his good-natured face.</p>
<p>There, in the middle of the precious cabbages,
biting with a sort of dainty eagerness at first one
and then another, and wantonly tearing open the
crisp heads with impatient strokes of his knife-edged
fore hoofs, was a tall wide-antlered buck.</p>
<p>Sam Coxen dropped the reins, sprang from the
wagon, and rushed to the bars which led from the
yard to the back field; and the horses&ndash;&ndash;for the
sake of his dignity he always drove the pair when
he went into the Settlement&ndash;&ndash;fell to cropping the
short, fine grass that grew behind the well. In spite
of having grown up in the backwoods, Sam was lacking
in backwoods lore. He was no hunter, and he
cared as little as he knew, about the wild kindreds of
the forest. He had a vague, general idea that all
deer were &#8220;skeery critters&#8221;; and if any one had
told him that the buck, in mating season, was not
unlikely to develop a fine militant spirit, he would
have laughed with scorn.</p>
<p>Climbing upon the bars, he yelled furiously at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
marauder, expecting to see him vanish like a red
streak. But the buck merely raised his beautiful
head and stared in mild surprise at the strange,
noisy figure on the fence. Then he coolly slashed
open another plump cabbage, and nibbled at the firm
white heart.</p>
<p>Very angry, Coxen yelled again with all the power
of healthy lungs, and waved his arms wildly over
his head. But the vaunted authority of the human
voice seemed in some inexplicable way to miss a
connexion with the buck&#8217;s consciousness. The
waving of those angry arms, however, made an impression
upon him. He appeared to take it as a
challenge, for he shook his beautiful antlers and
stamped his forefeet defiantly&ndash;&ndash;and shattered yet
another precious cabbage.</p>
<p>Wrath struggled with astonishment in Sam Coxen&#8217;s
primitive soul. Then he concluded that what he
wanted was not only vengeance, but a supply
of deer&#8217;s meat to compensate for the lost cabbages.</p>
<p>Rushing into the house, he snatched down his
old muzzle-loader from the pegs where it hung on
the kitchen wall. After the backwoods fashion,
the gun was kept loaded with a general utility
charge of buckshot and slugs, such as might come
handy in case a bear should try to steal the pig.
Being no sportsman, Coxen did not even take the
trouble to change the old percussion-cap, which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
had been on the tube for six months. It was
enough for him that the weapon was loaded.</p>
<p>Down the other slope of the hill, where the buck
could not see him, Coxen hurried at a run, and gained
the cover of the thick woods. Then, still running,
he skirted the fields till the cabbage patch came
once more in sight, with the marauder still enjoying
himself in the midst of it.</p>
<p>At this point the long-dormant instinct of the
hunter began to awake in Sam Coxen. Everything
that he had ever heard about stalking big game
flashed into his mind, and he wanted to apply it all
at once. He noted the direction of the wind, and
was delighted to find that it came to his nostrils
straight from the cabbage patch.</p>
<p>He went stealthily, lifting and setting down his
heavy-booted feet with a softness of which he had
never guessed himself capable. He began to forget
his indignation and think only of the prospect of
bagging the game&ndash;&ndash;so easily do the primeval instincts
spring to life in a man&#8217;s brain. Presently,
when within about a hundred yards of the place
where he hoped to get a fair shot, Coxen redoubled
his caution. He went crouching, keeping behind
the densest cover. Then, growing still more crafty,
he got down and began to advance on all fours.</p>
<p>Now it chanced that Sam Coxen&#8217;s eyes were not the
only ones which had found interest in the red buck&#8217;s
proceedings. A large black bear, wandering just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
within the shelter of the forest, had spied the buck
in the open, and being curious, after the fashion
of his kind, had sat down in a thicket to watch the
demolition of the cabbages.</p>
<p>He had no serious thought of hunting the big
buck, knowing that he would be hard to catch
and troublesome if caught. But he was in that
investigating, pugnacious, meddlesome mood which
is apt to seize an old male bear in the autumn.</p>
<p>When the bear caught sight of Sam Coxen&#8217;s crawling,
stealthy figure, not two paces from his hiding-place,
his first impulse was to vanish, to melt away like a
big, portentous shadow into the silent deeps of the
wood. His next, due to the season, was to rush
upon the man and smite him.</p>
<p>Then he realized that he himself was not the
object of the man&#8217;s stealthy approach. He saw
that what the hunter was intent upon was that buck
out in the field. Thereupon he sank back on his
great black haunches to watch the course of events.
Little did Sam Coxen guess of those cunning red
eyes that followed him as he crawled by.</p>
<p>At the point where the cover came nearest to the
cabbage patch, Coxen found himself still out of
range. Cocking his gun, he strode some twenty
paces into the open, paused, and took a long, deliberate
aim.</p>
<p>Catching sight of him the moment he emerged,
the buck stood for some moments eyeing him with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
sheer curiosity. Was this a harmless passer-by, or
a would-be trespasser on his new domain of cabbages?
On second glance, he decided that it looked
like the noisy figure which had waved defiance from
the top of the fence. Realizing this, a red gleam
came into the buck&#8217;s eye. He wheeled, stamped,
and shook his antlers in challenge.</p>
<p>At this moment, having got a good aim, Coxen pulled
the trigger. The cap refused to explode. Angrily he
lowered the gun, removed the cap and examined
it. It looked all right, and there was plenty of
priming in the tube. He turned the cap round,
and again took careful aim.</p>
<p>Now these actions seemed to the buck nothing
less than a plain invitation to mortal combat. He
was in just the mood to accept such an invitation.
In two bounds he cleared the cabbages and came
mincingly down to the fray.</p>
<p>This unexpected turn of affairs so flustered the
inexperienced hunter that he altogether forgot to
cock his gun. Twice he pulled desperately on the
trigger, but with no result. Then, smitten with a
sense of impotence, he hurled the gun at the enemy
and fled.</p>
<p>Over the fence he went almost at a bound, and
darted for the nearest tree that looked easy to
climb. As his ill luck would have it, this tree stood
just on the edge of the thicket wherein the much-interested
bear was keeping watch.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></p>
<p>A wild animal knows when a man is running away,
and rarely loses a chance to show its appreciation
of the fact. As Sam Coxen sprang for the lowest
branch and swung himself up, the bear lumbered
out from his thicket and reared himself menacingly
against the trunk.</p>
<p>The buck, who had just cleared the fence, stopped
short. It was clearly his turn now to play the
part of spectator.</p>
<p>When Coxen looked down and saw his new foe
his heart swelled with a sense of injury. Were the
creatures of the wilderness allied against him?
He was no coward, but he began to feel distinctly
worried. The thought that flashed across his mind
was: &#8220;What&#8217;ll happen to the team if I don&#8217;t get
back to unharness them?&#8221; But meanwhile he was
climbing higher and higher, and looking out for a
way of escape.</p>
<p>About halfway up the tree a long branch thrust
itself forth till it fairly overhung a thick young
spruce. Out along this branch Coxen worked his
way carefully. By the time the bear had climbed
to one end of the branch, Coxen had reached the
other. Here he paused, dreading to let himself
drop.</p>
<p>The bear came on cautiously; and the great
branch bent low under his weight, till Coxen was
not more than a couple of feet from the top of the
young fir. Then, nervously letting go, he dropped,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
caught the thick branches in his desperate clutch,
and clung secure.</p>
<p>The big branch, thus suddenly freed of Coxen&#8217;s
substantial weight, sprang back with such violence
that the bear almost lost his hold. Growling angrily,
he scrambled back to the main trunk, down which
he began to lower himself, tail foremost.</p>
<p>From the business-like alacrity of the bear&#8217;s movements,
Coxen realized that his respite was to be only
temporary. He was not more than twelve feet from
the ground, and could easily have made his escape
while the bear was descending the other tree. But
there below was the buck, keeping an eye of alert
interest on both bear and man. Coxen had no mind
to face those keen antlers and trampling hoofs. He
preferred to stay where he was and hope for some
unexpected intervention of fate. Like most backwoodsmen,
he had a dry sense of the ridiculous, and
the gravity of his situation could not quite blind him
to the humour of it.</p>
<p>While Coxen was running over in his mind every
conceivable scheme for getting out of his dilemma,
the last thing he would have thought of actually
happened. The buck lost interest in the man, and
turned all his attention to the bear, which was
just now about seven or eight feet from the ground,
hugging the great trunk and letting himself down
carefully, like a small boy afraid of tearing his
trousers.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></p>
<p>It is possible that that particular buck may have
had some old score against the bears. If so, this
must have seemed an excellent chance to collect a
little on account. The bear&#8217;s awkward position and
unprotected hind quarters evidently appealed to
him. He ambled forward, reared half playfully, half
vindictively, and gave the bear a savage prodding
with the keen tips of his antlers. Then he bounded
back some eight or ten paces, and waited, while the
bear slid abruptly to the ground with a flat grunt
of fury.</p>
<p>Sam Coxen, twisting with silent laughter, nearly
fell out of his fir-tree.</p>
<p>The bear had now no room left for any remembrance
of the man. He was in a perfect ecstasy of rage at
the insolence of the buck, and rushed upon him like
a cyclone. Against that irresistible charge the buck
had no thought of making stand. Just in the nick
of time he sprang aside in a bound that carried him a
full thirty feet. Another such, another and another,
and then he went capering off frivolously down the
woody aisles, while the bear lumbered impotently
after him.</p>
<p>Before they were out of sight Sam Coxen slid
down from his tree and made all haste over the
fence. In the open field he felt more at ease, knowing
he could outrun the bear, in case of need. But
he stopped long enough to pick up the gun.</p>
<p>Then, with one pathetic glance at the ruined cabbages,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
he strode hastily on up the hill, glancing
backward from time to time to assure himself that
neither of his late antagonists was returning to the
attack.</p>

<p>Around the little log cabin in the clearing
the snow lay nearly four feet deep. It loaded
the roof. It buried the low, broad, log barn almost
to the eaves. It whitely fenced in the trodden,
chip-littered, straw-strewn space of the yard which
lay between the barn and the cabin. It heaped itself
fantastically, in mounds and domes and pillars,
over the stumps that dotted the raw, young clearing.
It clung densely on the drooping branches of
the fir and spruce and hemlock. It mantled in a
kind of breathless, expectant silence the solitude of
the wilderness world.</p>
<p>Dave Patton, pushing down the blankets and
the many-coloured patchwork quilt, lifted himself on
one elbow and looked at the pale face of his young
wife. She was sleeping. He slipped noiselessly
out of the bunk, lightly pulled up the coverings
again, and hurriedly drew on two pairs of heavy,
home-knit socks of rough wool. The cabin was
filled with the grey light of earliest dawn, and with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
a biting cold that made the woodsman&#8217;s hardy
fingers ache. Stepping softly as a cat over the
rude plank floor, he made haste to pile the cooking-stove
with birch-bark, kindling, and split sticks
of dry, hard wood. At the touch of the match
the birch-bark caught and curled with a crisp
crackling, and with a roar in the strong draught the
cunningly piled mass burst into blaze. Dave Patton
straightened, and his grey eyes turned to a
little, low bunk with high sides in the farther
corner of the cabin.</p>
<p>Peering over the edge of the bunk with big, eager,
blue eyes, was a round little face framed in a tousled
mop of yellow hair. A red glare from the open
draught of the stove caught the child&#8217;s face. The
moment she saw her father looking at her she started
to climb out of the bunk; but Dave was instantly
at her side, kissing her and tucking her down again
into the blankets.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t git out o&#8217; bed, sweetie,&#8221; he whispered,
&#8220;till the house gits warmed up a bit. An&#8217;
don&#8217;t wake mother yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>The child&#8217;s eyes danced with eagerness, but she
restrained her voice as she replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought mebbe &#8217;twas Christmis, popsie!&#8221;
she whispered, catching his fingers. &#8220;&#8217;T first, I
thought mebbe you was Sandy Claus, popsie. Oh,
I wish Christmis &#8217;ld hurry up!&#8221;</p>
<p>A look of pain passed over Dave Patton&#8217;s face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Christmas won&#8217;t be along fer &#8217;most a week yit,
sweetie!&#8221; he answered, in the soft undertone that
took heed of his wife&#8217;s slumbers. &#8220;An&#8217; anyways,
how do you s&#8217;pose Sandy Claus is goin&#8217; to find his
way, &#8217;way out into these great woods, through all
this snow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, <i>popsie!</i>&#8221; cried the child, excitedly. Then,
remembering, she lowered her voice again to a
whisper. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know Sandy Claus kin go
<i>any</i>wheres? Snow, an&#8217; cold, an&#8217; the&ndash;&ndash;the&ndash;&ndash;the
big, black woods&ndash;&ndash;they don&#8217;t bother <i>him</i> one little,
teenty mite. He knows where to find me out here,
jest&#8217;s easy&#8217;s in at the Settlements, popsie!&#8221;</p>
<p>The mother stirred in her bunk, wakened by the
little one&#8217;s voice. She sat up, shivering, and pulled
a red shawl about her shoulders. Her eyes sought
Dave&#8217;s significantly and sympathetically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother&#8217;s girl must try an&#8217; not think so much
about Sandy Claus,&#8221; she pleaded. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want
her to go an&#8217; be disappointed. Sandy Claus lives
in at the Settlements, an&#8217; you know right well, girlie,
he couldn&#8217;t git &#8217;way out here, Christmas Eve, without
neglecting all the little boys an&#8217; girls at the
Settlements. You wouldn&#8217;t want <i>them all</i> disappointed,
just so&#8217;s he could come to our little girl
&#8217;way off here in the woods, what&#8217;s got her father an&#8217;
mother anyways!&#8221;</p>
<p>The child sat up straight in her bunk, her eyes
grew very wide and filled with tears, and her lips
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
quivered. This was the first really effective blow
that her faith in Christmas and in Santa Claus had
ever received. But instantly her faith recovered
itself. The eager light returned to her face, and she
shook her yellow head obstinately.</p>
<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t <i>have to</i> &#8217;lect the children in the Settlements,
will he, popsie?&#8221; she cried. And without
waiting for an answer, she went on: &#8220;He kin be
everywheres to oncet, Sandy Claus can. He&#8217;s so good
an&#8217; kind, he won&#8217;t forget <i>one</i> of the little boys an&#8217;
girls in the Settlements, nor me, out here in the
woods. Oh, mumsie, I wisht it was to-night was
Christmas Eve!&#8221; And in her happy anticipation
she bounced up and down in the bunk, a figure of
fairy joy in her blue flannel nightgown.</p>
<p>Dave turned away with a heavy heart and jammed
more wood into the stove. Then, pulling on his
thick cowhide &#8220;larrigans,&#8221; coat and woollen mittens,
he went out to fodder the cattle. With that joyous
roar of fresh flame in the stove the cabin was already
warming up, but outside the door, which Dave
closed quickly behind him, the cold had a kind of
still savagery, edged and instant like a knife. To a
strong man, however, it was a tonic, an honest challenging
to resistance. In spite of his sad preoccupation,
Dave responded to the cold air instinctively,
pausing outside the door to fill his deep lungs
and to glance at the thrilling mystery of the sunrise
before him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></p>
<p>The cabin stood at the top of the clearing
against a background of dense spruce forest which
sheltered it on the north and north-east. Across
the yard, on the western side of the cabin, the
log barn and the &#8220;lean-to&#8221; thrust up their laden
roofs from the surrounding snow. In front, the
cleared ground sloped away gently to the woods
below, a snow-swathed, mystically glimmering
expanse, its surface tumbled by the upthrust of
the muffled stumps. From the eastern corner of
the clearing, directly opposite the doorway before
which Dave was standing, the Settlements trail
led straight away, a lane of miraculous glory, into
the very focus of the sunrise.</p>
<p>For miles upon miles the slow slope of the wilderness
was towards the east, so that the trail was
like an open gate into the great space of earth
and sky. The sky, from the eastern horizon to
the zenith&ndash;&ndash;and that was all that Dave Patton
had eyes for&ndash;&ndash;was filled with a celestial rabble
of rose-pink vapours, thin a&euml;rial wisps of almost
unimaginable colour. Except the horizon! The
horizon, just where the magic portals of the trail
revealed it, was an unfathomable radiance of intense,
transparent, orange-crimson flame, so thrilling
in its strangeness that Dave seemed to feel his
spirit striving to draw it in as his lungs were drawing
in the vital air. From that fount of living light
rushed innumerable streams of thin colour, making
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
threads and stains and patches of mystical red among
the tops of the lower forest, and dyeing the snowy
surface of the clearing with the tints of mother-of-pearl
and opal. Dave turned his head to glance at
the cabin, the barn, and the woods behind them.
All were bathed in that transfiguring rush of glory.
The beauty of it gave him a curious pang, which
turned instantly, by some association too obscure for
him to trace, into an ache of grief at the disappointment
that was hanging over his little one&#8217;s gaily
trusting heart. The fairylike quality of the scene
before him made him think, by a mingling of sympathy
and far-off, dim remembrance, of the fairy
glamour and unreal radiance of beauty that Christmas
tree and Christmas toys stood for in the child&#8217;s
bright anticipations. He reminded himself of the
glittering delights with which, during the past
three Christmases, Lidey&#8217;s kinsfolk in the Settlement
had lovingly surrounded her. Now he, her
father, could do nothing to make her Christmas
different from all these other days of whose shut-in
monotony she was wearying. Hope, now, and
excited wonder were giving the little one new life.
Dave Patton cringed within at the thought of the
awakening, the disillusionment, the desolation of
sorrow that would come to the baby heart with the
dawn of Christmas. He was overwhelmed with
self-reproach, because he had not realized all this
in time to make provision, before the deep snow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
had blocked the trail to the Settlement. Now,
what <i>could</i> he do?</p>
<p>Heavily Dave strode across the yard to the door
of the barn. At the sound of his feet crunching
the trodden and brittle snow, there came low mooings
of eagerness from the expectant cattle in the barn.
As he lifted the massive wooden latch and opened
the door, the horse whinnied to him from the innermost
stall, there was a welcoming shuffle of hoofs,
and a comfortable warmth puffed steamily out in
his face. From the horse&#8217;s stall, from the stanchions
of the cattle, big, soft eyes all turned to him.
As he bundled the scented hay into the mangers,
and listened to the contented snortings and puffings
as soft muzzles tossed the fodder, he thought how
happy these creatures were in their warm security.
He thought how happy he was, and his wife, reunited
to him after three years of forced and almost continuous
separation. For him, and for the young
wife, now recovering health in the tonic air of the
spruce land after years of invalidism, this had
promised to be a Christmas of unalloyed gladness.
To one only, to the little one whose happiness
was his continual thought, the day would be dark
with the shattering of cherished hopes. The more
he thought of it, the more he felt that it was not to
be borne. Faint but piteous memories from his own
childhood stirred in his brain, and he realized how
irremediable, how final and desperate, seem a child&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
small sorrows. A sudden resolve took hold upon
him. This bitterness, at least, his little one should
not know. He jammed the pitchfork energetically
back into the mow and left the barn with the quick
step of an assured purpose.</p>
<p>Three years before this, Dave Patton, after a
series of misfortunes in the Settlement, which had
reduced him to sharp poverty, had been forced to
leave his wife and three-years-old baby with her own
people, while he betook himself into the remotest
wilderness to carve out a new home for them on a
tract of forest land which was all that remained of
his possessions. The land was fertile and carried
good timber, and he had begun to prosper. But his
wife&#8217;s ill-health had long made it impossible for her
to face the hardships and risks of a pioneer&#8217;s life
two days&#8217; journey from the nearest civilization.
Not till the preceding spring had Dave dared to bring
his family out to the wilderness home that he had
so long been making ready for them. Then, however,
it had proved a success. In that high and healing
air he had seen the colour slowly come back to his
wife&#8217;s pale cheeks; and as for the child, until the
great snows came and cut her off from this novel
and interesting world, she had been absorbingly
happy in the fellowship of the wilderness.</p>
<p>When Dave re-entered the cabin, he found the
table set over by the window, and his wife beating up
the batter for the buckwheat pancakes that she was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
about to griddle for breakfast. Lidey, still in her
little blue flannel nightgown, but with beaded deerskin
moccasins on her tiny feet, and the golden wilfulness
of her hair tied back demurely with a blue
ribbon, was seated at one end of the table, her eager
face half buried in a sheet of paper. She was laboriously
inditing, for perhaps the twentieth time, an
epistle to &#8220;Sandy Claus,&#8221; telling him what she hoped
he would bring her.</p>
<p>If anything had been needed to confirm Dave
Patton in his resolve, it was this. From the rapt
child his eyes turned and met his wife&#8217;s inquiring
glance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I&#8217;ve got to go, Mary!&#8221; he said quietly.
&#8220;Think you two kin git along all right fer four or
five days? We ain&#8217;t likely to have no more snow
this moon.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman let a little sigh escape her, but the look
she gave her husband was one of cheerful acquiescence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;re right, dear! I&#8217;ll have to let you
go, though five days seems an awful long time to be
alone here. I&#8217;ve been thinkin&#8217; it over,&#8221; she continued,
guarding her words so that Lidey should not understand&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;an&#8217;
I just couldn&#8217;t bear to see it, Dave!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so!&#8221; assented the man. &#8220;I&#8217;ll leave
heaps o&#8217; wood an&#8217; kindlin&#8217; cut, an&#8217; you&#8217;ll jest have to
milk an&#8217; look after the beasts, dear. Long&#8217;s you&#8217;re
not <i>scairt</i> to be alone, it&#8217;s all right, I reckon!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></p>
<p>&#8220;When&#8217;ll you start?&#8221; asked the wife, turning
to pour the batter in little, sputtering, grey-white
circles on to the hot, greased griddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;First thing to-morrow mornin&#8217;!&#8221; answered
Dave, seating himself at the table as the appetizing
smell of the browning pancakes filled the room.
&#8220;Snow&#8217;s jest right for snowshoein&#8217;, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll git back
easy Christmas Eve.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You sure won&#8217;t be late, popsie?&#8221; interrupted the
child, looking up with apprehension in her round
eyes. &#8220;I jest wouldn&#8217;t care one mite for Sandy Claus
if you weren&#8217;t here too!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe I&#8217;ll git him to give me a lift in his little
sleigh! Anyways, I&#8217;ll be back!&#8221; laughed Dave,
gaily.</p>
<p style='text-align:center; margin:1em auto 1.5em auto;'>II</p>
<p>After Dave had gone, setting out at daybreak on
his moose-hide snowshoes, which crunched musically
on the hard snow, things went very well for a
while at the lonely clearing. It was not so lonely,
either, during the bright hours about midday, when
the sunshine managed to accumulate something
almost like warmth in the sheltered yard. About
noon the two red and white cows and the yoke of
wide-horned red oxen would stand basking in front
of the lean-to, near the well, contentedly chewing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
their cuds. At this time the hens, too, yellow and
black and speckled, would come out and scratch in
the litter, perennially undiscouraged by the fact
that the only thing they found beneath it was the
snow. The vivid crossbills, red and black and
white, would come to the yard in flocks, and the
quaker-coloured snow-buntings, and the big, trustful,
childlike, pine grosbeaks, with the growing stain
of rose-purple over their heads and necks. These
kept Lidey interested, helping to pass the days that
now, to her excited anticipations, seemed so long.
Perhaps half a dozen times a day she would print
a difficult communication to Santa Claus with some
new idea, some new suggestion. These missives were
mailed to the good Saint of Children by the swift
medium of the roaring kitchen fire; and as the draught
whisked their scorching fragments upwards, Lidey
was satisfied that they went straight to their destination.
The child&#8217;s joy in her anticipations was now
the more complete because, since her father&#8217;s departure,
her mother had ceased to discourage her
hopes.</p>
<p>On the day before Christmas Eve, however, the
mother felt symptoms of a return of her old sickness.
Immediately she grew anxious, realizing how necessary
it was that she should keep well. This nervous
apprehension hastened the result that she most
dreaded. Her pain and her weakness grew worse
hour by hour. Mastered by her memories of what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
she had been through before, she was in no mood
to throw off the attack. That evening, crawling to
the barn with difficulty, she amazed the horse and
the cattle by coaxing them to drink again, then piled
their mangers with a two-days&#8217; store of hay, and
scattered buckwheat recklessly for the hens. The
next morning she could barely drag herself out of bed
to light the fire; and Lidey had to make her breakfast&ndash;&ndash;which
she did contentedly enough&ndash;&ndash;on bread
and butter and unlimited molasses.</p>
<p>It was a weary day for the little one, in spite of
her responsibilities. Muffled up and mittened, she
was able, under her mother&#8217;s directions, to carry a
little water to the stock in a small tin kettle, making
many journeys. And she was able to keep the
fire going. But the hours crept slowly, and she
was so consumed with impatience that all her
usual amusements lost their savour. Not even
the rare delight of being allowed to cut pictures
out of some old illustrated papers could divert her
mind from its dazzling anticipations. But before
Christmas could come, must come her father; and
from noon onward she would keep running to the
door every few minutes to peer expectantly down
the trail. She was certain that, at the worst, he
could not by any possibility be delayed beyond
supper-time, for he was needed to get supper&ndash;&ndash;or,
rather, as Lidey expressed it, to help her get supper
for mother! Lidey was not hungry, to be sure, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
she was getting mortally tired of unmitigated bread
and butter and molasses.</p>
<p>Supper-time, however, came and went, and no sign
of Dave&#8217;s return. On the verge of tears, Lidey
munched a little of the now distasteful food. Her
mother, worn out with the pain, which had at last
relaxed its grip, fell into a heavy sleep. There was
no light in the cabin except the red glow from the
open draught of the stove, and the intense, blue-white
moonlight streaming in through the front window.
The child&#8217;s impatience became intolerable.</p>
<p>Flinging open the door for the hundredth time,
she gazed out eagerly across the moonlit snow and
down the trail. The cloudless moon, floating
directly above it, transfigured that narrow and lonely
road into a path to wonderland. In the mystic
radiance&ndash;&ndash;blue-white, but shot with faint, half-imagined
flashes of emerald and violet&ndash;&ndash;Lidey could
see no loneliness whatever. The monstrous solitude
became to her eyes a garden of silver and crystal.
As she gazed, it lured her irresistibly.</p>
<p>With a sudden resolve she noiselessly closed the
door, lit the lamp, and began to put on her wraps,
stealing about on tiptoe that she might not awaken
her mother. She was quite positive that, by this
time, her father must be almost home. As her little
brain dwelt upon this idea, she presently brought
herself to see him, striding swiftly along in the moonlight
just beyond the turn of the trail. If she hurried,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
she could meet him before he came out upon the
clearing. The thought possessed her. Stealing a
cautious glance at her mother&#8217;s face to be sure her
sleep was sound, she slipped out into the shine. A
moment more and her tiny figure, hooded and muffled
and mittened, was dancing on moccasined feet across
the snow.</p>
<p>At the entrance to the trail, Lidey felt the first qualm
of misgiving. The path of light, to be sure, with
all its fairy-book enticement, lay straight before
her. But the solemn woods, on either side of the
path, were filled with great shadows and a terrible
stillness. At this point Lidey had half a mind to
turn back. But she was already a young person of
positive ideas, not lightly to be swerved from a purpose;
and her too vivid imagination still persisted
in showing her that picture of her father, speeding
towards her just beyond the turn of the trail.
She even thought that she could hear his steps upon
the daunting stillness. With her heart quivering,
yet uplifted by an exaltation of hope, she ran on,
not daring to glance again into the woods. To sustain
her courage she kept thinking of the look of gay
astonishment that would flash into her father&#8217;s face
as he met her running towards him&ndash;&ndash;just around
the turn of the trail!</p>
<p>The turn was nearly a quarter of a mile distant,
but the child reached it at last. With a little cry
of confident relief she rushed forward. The long
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
trail&ndash;&ndash;now half in shadow from the slight change
in its direction&ndash;&ndash;stretched out empty before her.
In the excess of her disappointment she burst into
tears and sat down on the snow irresolutely.</p>
<p>Her first impulse&ndash;&ndash;after she had cried for a minute,
and wiped her eyes with the little mittens, which
promptly stiffened in the stinging frost&ndash;&ndash;was to face
about and run for home as fast as she could. But
when she turned and glanced behind her, the backward
path appeared quite different. When she
no longer faced the moonlight, the world took on an
unfriendly, sinister look. There were unknown terrors
all along that implacable blue-white way through
the dread blackness of the woods. Sobbing with
desolation, she turned again towards the moon.
Ahead, for all her fears, the trail still held something
of the glamour and the dazzle. Ahead, too,
as she reminded herself, was surely her father, hastening
to meet her, only not quite so near as she had
imagined. Summoning back her courage, and
comforting her lonely spirit with thoughts of what
Santa Claus was going to bring her, she picked herself
up and continued her journey at a hurried little
walk.</p>
<p>She had not gone more than a few steps, when a
strange, high sound, from somewhere far behind
her, sent her heart into her throat and quickened
her pace to a run.</p>
<p>Again came that high, long-drawn, quavering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
sound; and the child&#8217;s heart almost stopped beating.
If only she could see her father coming! She had
never heard any sound just like that; it was not savage,
nor very loud, but somehow it seemed to carry a
kind of horror on its floating cadence. It reminded
her, very faintly, of the howling of some dogs that
she had heard in the Settlement. She was not afraid
of dogs. But she knew there were no dogs in the
forest.</p>
<p>Just as she was beginning to lose her breath and
slacken her pace, that terrible cry came wavering
again through the trees, much louder now and nearer.
It lent new strength to her tired little feet, and she
fled on faster than ever, her red lips open and her
eyes wide. Another slight turn of the trail, and it
ran once more directly towards the moon, stretching
on and on till it narrowed from sight. And nowhere
in the shining track was Dave to be seen. Lidey
had now, however, but one thought in her quivering
brain, and that was to keep running and get to her
father before those dreadful voices could overtake her.
She knew they were coming up swiftly. They sounded
terribly near. When she had gone about two hundred
yards beyond the last bend of the trail, she
noticed, a few steps ahead of her, a tiny clearing,
and at its farther edge the gable of a little hut rising
a couple of feet above the snow. She knew the
place. She had played in it that summer, while
Dave was cutting the coarse hay on the clearing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
It was a place that had been occupied by lonely trappers
and lumber prospectors. Being a work of men&#8217;s
hands, it gave the child a momentary sense of comfort,
of companionship in the dreadful wild. She paused,
uncertain whether to continue along the trail or to
seek the shelter of the empty hut.</p>
<p>When the crunching of her own little footsteps
stopped, however, she was instantly aware of the
padding of other feet behind her. Looking back, she
saw a pack of grey beasts just coming around the turn.
They were something like dogs. But Lidey knew
they were not dogs. She had seen pictures of them&ndash;&ndash;awful
pictures. She had read stories of them which
had frozen her blood as she read. Now, her very
bones seemed to melt within her. They were wolves!
For a moment her throat could form no sound.
Then&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;Father!&#8221; she screamed despairingly, and
rushed for the hut.</p>
<p>As she reached it, the wolves were hardly a dozen
paces behind. The door stood half open, but drifted
full of snow to within little more than a foot of the
top. Into the low opening the child dived head
first, like a rabbit, crept behind the door, and fell
upon the snow, gasping, too horror-stricken to make
any outcry.</p>
<p>A step from the hut door the wolves halted
abruptly. The half-buried hut, and the dark hole
leading into it&ndash;&ndash;these were things they did not
understand, except that they recognized them as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
belonging to man. Anything belonging to man was
dangerous. In that dark hole they suspected a trap.
The leader went up to it, and almost poked his nose
into it, sniffing. But he backed away sharply as if
he had met with a blow on the snout, and his
nostrils wrinkled in savage enmity. The man
smell was strong in the hut. It seemed very like a
trap.</p>
<p>Lying flat on her stomach behind the door, Lidey
stared out through the narrow crack with eyes that
seemed starting from her head. Out there in the
clear glitter of the moonlight she saw the wolves go
prowling savagely to and fro, and heard their steps
as they cautiously circled the hut, seeking another
entrance. They kept about five or six feet distant
from it at first, so suspicious were they of that man
smell that had greeted the leader&#8217;s first attempt at
investigation. When they had prowled about the
hut for several minutes, they all sat down on their
haunches before the door and seemed to deliberate.
The child felt their dreadful eyes piercing her through
and through, as they searched her out through the
crack and penetrated her vain hiding.</p>
<p>Suddenly, while the eyes of all the pack were
flaming upon her, she saw the leader come swiftly forward
and thrust his fierce snout right against the
crack of the door. In a sort of madness she struck
at it with her little, mittened hand. The wolf, apparently
still disconcerted by the man smell that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
greeted his nostrils, sprang back warily. Then the
whole pack drew a foot or two closer to the open
doorway. Ravenous though they were, they were
not yet assured that the hut was not a trap. They
were not yet quite ready to crawl in and secure their
prey. But gradually they were edging nearer. A
few moments more and the leader, no less crafty than
savage, would creep in. Already he had accustomed
himself to the menace of that scent. Now, he did
creep in, as far as the middle of his body, investigating.
His red jaws and long, white teeth appeared
around the edge of the door. At the sight Lidey&#8217;s
voice returned to her. Shrinking back against the
farthest wall, she gave shriek after shriek that seemed
to tear the dreadful stillness. In the madness of her
terror she hardly noticed that the wolf&#8217;s head was
suddenly withdrawn.</p>

<p>When Dave Patton set out for the Settlement, he
found the snow-shoeing so good, the biting air so
bracing, and his own heart so light with hope and
health, that he was able to make the journey in
something less than a day and a half. Out of this time
he had allowed himself four hours for sleep, in an old
lumber camp beside the trail. At the Settlement,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
which boasted several miscellaneous stores, where
anything from a baby&#8217;s rattle to a bag of fertilizer
or a bedroom suite could be purchased, he had no
difficulty in gathering such gay-coloured trifles,
together with more lasting gifts, as he thought would
meet Lidey&#8217;s anticipations. When he went to his
wife&#8217;s people, he found that all had something to
add to his Santa Claus pack, for Mary as well as
for the little one; and he hugged himself with elation
at the thought of what a Christmas there was
going to be in the lonely wilderness cabin. He had
bought two or three things for his wife; and when he
shouldered his pack, slinging it high and strapping
it close that it might not flop with his rapid stride,
he found the burden no light one. But the lightness
of his heart made compensation.</p>
<p>That night he took but two hours&#8217; sleep in the old
lumber camp, aiming to reach home soon after noon.
In the morning, however, things began to go wrong.
First the pack, as packs sometimes will for no visible
reason, developed a kink that galled his shoulders
obstinately. Again and again he paused and tried to
readjust it. But in vain. Finally he had to stop,
undo the bundle, and rearrange every article in it,
before he could induce it to &#8220;carry&#8221; smoothly.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, as he turned a step off the trail
to get a drink at a bubbling spring, that kept open
all through the bitterest winter, he caught his snowshoe
on a buried branch and fell forward, breaking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
the frame. In his angry impatience he attempted
no more than a temporary repair of the damage,
such as he thought might see him to the end of his
journey. But the poor makeshift broke down before
he had gone a mile. There was nothing for him to
do but to stop long enough to make a good job of
it, which he did by chopping out a piece of ash, whittling
down a couple of thin but tough strips, and splicing
the break securely with the strong &#8220;salmon
twine&#8221; that he always carried. Even so, he realized
that to avoid further delay he would have to go cautiously
and humour the mend. And soon he had
to acknowledge to himself that it would be long after
supper-time, long after Lidey&#8217;s bed-time, before he
could get home.</p>
<p>As the moon rose, he was accompanied by his
shadow, a gigantic and grotesque figure that danced
fantastically along the snow before him. As the moon
climbed the icy heaven, the shadow shortened and
acquired more sobriety of demeanour. Plodding doggedly
onward, too tired to think, Dave amused himself
with the antics of the shadow, which seemed responsible
for a portion of the crisp music that came
from his snowshoes.</p>
<p>From this careless reverie Dave was suddenly
aroused by a ghost of sound that drifted towards him
through the trees. It was a long, wailing cry, which
somehow stirred the roots of his hair. He did not
recognize it. But he felt that it was nothing human.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
It came from somewhere between himself and home,
however; and he instinctively quickened his steps,
thinking with satisfaction of the snug and well-warmed
cabin that sheltered his dear ones.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<a name='linki_4' id='linki_4'></a>
<img src='images/illus-098.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 384px; height: 522px;' /><br />

&#8220;<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Where anything from a baby&#8217;s rattle to a bag of fertilizer could be purchased</span>.&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>Presently the long cry sounded again, nearer and
clearer now, and tremulous. Dave had heard
wolves before, in Labrador and in the West. Had he
not been quite sure that wolves were unknown in this
part of the country, he would have sworn that the
sound was the hunting cry of a wolf-pack. But
the idea was impossible. He had no sooner made up
his mind to this, however, than the cry was repeated
once more. Thereupon Dave reluctantly changed
his mind. That the sound meant wolves was not only
possible, but certain. It filled him with resentment
to think that those ravening marauders had come into
the country.</p>
<p>It was soon manifest to Dave&#8217;s initiated ears
that the wolves were coming directly towards him.
But he gathered, too, that they were in pursuit of some
quarry. Dave had the eastern woodsman&#8217;s contempt
for wolves, unless in a very large pack; and he soon
decided that this pack was a small one. He did not
think that it would dare to face him. Nevertheless,
he recognized the remote possibility of their being
so hungry as to forget their dread of man. That in
such case his axe would be an all-sufficient defence
he did not doubt. But he was in a fierce hurry to
get home. He did not want to be stopped and forced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
into any fight. For a moment he thought of turning
off through the woods and giving these night foragers
a wide berth. Then he remembered his uncertain
snowshoes. The snow would be very soft off the
trail, and there would be the chance of breaking
the shoe again. Who was he, to be turned out of his
path by a bunch of wild curs? It was the snow-shoe
that settled it. He set his jaws grimly, unslung his
axe, and pressed forward. The clamour of the pack
was now so near and loud that it quite drowned one
single, piercing cry of &#8220;Father!&#8221; that would otherwise
have reached his ears. There was a new note
in the howling, too, which Dave&#8217;s ear interpreted as
meaning that the quarry was in sight. Then the
noise stopped abruptly, save for an impatient yelp
or two.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever it be they&#8217;re after, it&#8217;s took to cover,&#8221;
said Dave to himself. &#8220;An&#8217; in the old shanty, too!&#8221;
he added, as he saw the little patch of clearing open
before him.</p>
<p>Realizing that the wolves had something to occupy
fully their attention, he now crept noiselessly forward
just within the edge of the wood. Peering forth
from behind the cover of a drooping hemlock branch,
he saw the roof of the hut, the half-open doorway
nearly choked with snow, and the wolves prowling
and sniffing around it, but keeping a couple of yards
away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Scairt of a trap!&#8221; he thought to himself with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
a grin, and cursed his luck that he had not his rifle
with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;A couple o&#8217; them thick, grey pelts,&#8221; he thought&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;what
a coat they&#8217;d make for the little one!&#8221;</p>
<p>There were six wolves, and big ones&ndash;&ndash;enough to
make things look pretty ugly for one man with only
an axe. Dave was glad they had something to keep
them from turning their attention to him. He
watched them for a few moments, then decided to
go around by the other side of the clearing and
avoid trouble.</p>
<p>He drew back as silently as a lynx. Where the
woods overhead were thick, the snow was soft,
with no crispness on the surface; and instead of
the crunching that his steps made on the trail, here
the snow made no sound under his feet but a sort of
thick sigh.</p>
<p>Dave had taken several paces in retreat, when an
idea flashed up that arrested him. <i>Why</i> were the
wolves so wary about entering the hut, when
their quarry was certainly inside? Their dread of
a trap was not, of itself, quite enough to explain
their caution. The thought gave him a qualm of
uneasiness. He would return and have another
look at them! Then his impatience got the better
of him. Mary and the little one were waiting and
watching for him at home. He retreated another
pace or two. What should he be doing, wasting
his time over a parcel of wolves that had got a fox
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
cornered in the old shanty? Dave felt sure it was
a fox. But no! He could not escape the conviction&ndash;&ndash;much
as he wished to&ndash;&ndash;that if the fugitive
were a fox, or any other animal of the north-eastern
woods, it would not take six hungry wolves
much more than six seconds to get over their suspicions
and go in after him. What if it should be
some half-starved old Indian, working his way into
the Settlement after bad luck with his hunting and
his trapping! Whoever it was, he had no gun,
or there would have been shooting before this.
Dave saw that he must go back and look into the
matter. But he was angry at this new delay. Cursing
the wolves, and the Indian who didn&#8217;t know
enough to take care of himself, Dave stole back to
his covert behind the hemlock branch, and peered
forth once more, no longer interested, but aggrieved.</p>
<p>The wolves were now sitting on their haunches
around the hut door. Their unusual behaviour convinced
him that there was a man inside. Well, there
was no getting around the fact that he was in for a
fight. He only hoped that the chap inside was some
good, and would have &#8220;somethin&#8217; to say fer himself,
darn him!&#8221; Dave gently lowered the bundle
from his back, and threw off his thick coat to allow
his arms freer play.</p>
<p>It was at this moment that the leader of the pack
made up his mind to crawl into the hut.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></p>
<p>As the wolf&#8217;s head entered the low opening, Dave
gripped his axe, thrust aside the hemlock branch, and
silently darted forth into the clearing. He did
not shout, for he wanted to take his enemies, as far
as possible, unawares. He had but a score of yards
to go. So intent were they upon their leader&#8217;s movements
that Dave was almost upon them ere they
heeded the sound of his coming. Then they looked
around. Three shrank back, startled at the tall
and threatening shape. But two sprang at his throat
with snapping jaws. The first met the full sweep of
his axe, in the chest and dropped in a heap. The
second dodged a short blow and warily drew back
again. Then, from within the darkness of the hut,
came those screams of the madness of terror.</p>
<p>For one beat Dave&#8217;s heart stopped. He knew the
voice!</p>
<p>The big wolf was just backing out. He turned,
jerking himself around like a loosed spring, as he
saw Dave towering over him. But he was not
in time. The axe descended, sheering his haunches
across, and he stretched out, working his great jaws
convulsively. Dave saw that the jaws had no blood
upon them, and his own blood returned to his heart.
He had come in time. The screams within the hut
died into piteous sobs.</p>
<p>Across Dave&#8217;s mind flamed a vision of the agony of
horror that Lidey had been suffering since first
those howlings fell upon his ears. His heart-break
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
transformed itself into a mad rage of vengeance.
As he turned, with a hoarse shout, upon the rest
of the pack, he felt a hot breath on his neck, and
bare fangs snapped savagely within an inch of his
throat. His assailant sprang back in time to escape
the deadly sweep of the axe, but at the same
instant the other three were leaping in. One of
these caught a glancing blow, which drove him off,
snarling. But the other two were so close that there
was no time for Dave to recover. Instinctively he
jabbed a short back-stroke with the end of the axe-handle,
and caught one of his assailants in the belly.
Sickened, and daunted by this unexpected form of
reprisal, the brute hunched itself with a startled
yelp and ran off with its tail between its legs. At the
same moment, dropping the axe, Dave caught the
other wolf fairly by the throat. The gripping hand
was a kind of weapon that the beast had never
learned to guard against, and it was taken at a disadvantage.
With a grunt of fury and of effort Dave
closed his grip inexorably, braced himself, and swung
the heavy brute off its feet. Whirling it clear
around his head, he let go. The animal flew sprawling
and twisting through the air, and came down on
its back ten feet away. When it landed, there was
no more fight left in it. Before Dave could reach
it with his axe it was up and away in a panic after its
two remaining fellows.</p>
<p>Breathing heavily from his effort and from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
storm of emotion still surging in his breast, Dave
turned to the hut door and called&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lidey! Lidey! Are you there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Popsie! Oh, popsie, <i>dear!</i> I thought you weren&#8217;t
goin&#8217; to come!&#8221; cried a quivering little voice. And
the child crept out into the moonlight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, popsie!&#8221; she sobbed, hiding her eyes in his
neck as he crushed her to his heart, &#8220;they were goin&#8217;
to eat me up, an&#8217; I thought you wouldn&#8217;t ever
come!&#8221;</p>
<p style='text-align:center; margin:1em auto 1.5em auto;'>IV</p>
<p>With the bundle on his back and Lidey in his arms,
Dave strode homeward, his weariness forgotten.
His first anxiety about his wife was somewhat
eased when he learned that Lidey had left her asleep;
for he remembered that a heavy sleep always marked
the end of one of her attacks. He only hoped that
the sleep would hold her until they got home, for
his heart sank at the thought of her terror if she should
wake and find Lidey gone. As they came out on the
edge of the clearing, and saw that all was quiet in the
cabin, Dave said&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t tell mother nothin&#8217; about the wolves
to-night, sweetie, eh? It &#8217;ld jest git her all worked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
up, an&#8217; she couldn&#8217;t stand it when she&#8217;s sick. We
won&#8217;t say nothin&#8217; about that till to-morrow!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; murmured Lidey, &#8220;she&#8217;d be awful
scairt!&#8221;</p>
<p>They were then about halfway up the slope, when
from the cabin came a frightened cry of &#8220;Lidey!
Lidey!&#8221; The door was flung open, the lamplight
streamed out in futile contest with the moonlight, and
Mrs. Patton appeared. Her face was white with
fear. As she saw Dave and the little one hurrying
towards her, both hands went to her heart in the
extremity of her relief, and she sank back into a chair
before the door.</p>
<p>Dave kicked off his snow-shoes with a dexterous
twist, stepped inside, slammed the door, and with
a laugh and a kiss deposited Lidey in her mother&#8217;s
lap.</p>
<p>&#8220;She jest run down to meet me!&#8221; explained Dave,
truthfully but deceptively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, girlie, how you frightened me!&#8221; cried
the woman, divided between tears and smiles. &#8220;I
woke up, Dave, an&#8217; found her gone; an&#8217; bein&#8217; kind o&#8217;
bewildered, I couldn&#8217;t understand it!&#8221;</p>
<p>She clung to his hand, while he looked tenderly
down into her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor little woman!&#8221; he murmured, &#8220;you&#8217;ve
had a bad turn ag&#8217;in, Lidey tells me. Better now,
eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m plumb all right ag&#8217;in, Dave, now you&#8217;re
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
back,&#8221; she answered, squeezing his hand hard.
&#8220;But land&#8217;s sakes, Dave, how ever did you git all
that blood on your pants?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said the man, lightly, &#8220;that&#8217;s nothin.&#8217;
Tell you about it bime-by. I&#8217;m jest starvin&#8217; now.
Let&#8217;s have supper quick, and then give old Mr. Sandy
Claus a chance. Tomorrow we&#8217;re going to have the
greatest Christmas ever was, us three!&#8221;</p>

</div>
<p style='text-align:center; margin:1em auto 1.5em auto;'>I</p>
<p>It was heavy sledding on the Upper Ottanoonsis
trail. The two lumbermen were nearing the
close of the third day of the hard four days&#8217; haul
in from the Settlements to the camp. At the head
of the first team, his broad jaw set and his small grey
eyes angry with fatigue, trudged the big figure
of Red McWha, choosing and breaking a way
through the deep snow. With his fiery red head and
his large red face, he was the only one of his colouring
in a large family so dark that they were known
as the &#8220;Black McWhas,&#8221; and his temper seemed
to have been chronically soured by the singularity
of his type. But he was a good woodsman and a
good teamster, and his horses followed confidently
at his heels like dogs. The second team was led by
a tall, gaunt-jawed, one-eyed lumberman named
Jim Johnson, but invariably known as &#8220;Walley.&#8221;
From the fact that his blind eye was of a peculiar
blankness, like whitish porcelain, he had been nicknamed
&#8220;Wall-Eye&#8221;; but, owing to his general
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
popularity, combined with the emphatic views he
held on that particular subject, the name had been
mitigated to Walley.</p>
<p>The two were hauling in supplies for Conroy&#8217;s
Camp, on Little Ottanoonsis Lake. Silently, but
for the clank and creak of the harness, and the
soft &#8220;thut, thut&#8221; of the trodden snow, the little
procession toiled on through the soundless desolation.
Between the trees&ndash;&ndash;naked birches and scattered,
black-green firs&ndash;&ndash;filtered the lonely, yellowish-violet
light of the fading winter afternoon. When
the light had died into ghostly grey along the corridors
of the forest, the teams rounded a turn of the
trail, and began to descend the steep slope which
led down to Joe Godding&#8217;s solitary cabin on the edge
of Burnt Brook Meadows. Presently the dark outline
of the cabin came into view against the pallor of
the open clearing.</p>
<p>But there was no light in the window. No
homely pungency of wood-smoke breathed welcome
on the bitter air. The cabin looked startlingly
deserted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoa!&#8221; commanded McWha, sharply, and
glanced round at Johnson with an angry misgiving
in his eyes. The teams came to a stop with a shiver
of all their bells.</p>
<p>Then, upon the sudden stillness, arose the faint
sound of a child&#8217;s voice, crying hopelessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something wrong down yonder!&#8221; growled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
McWha, his expectations of a hot supper crumbling
into dust.</p>
<p>As he spoke, Walley Johnson sprang past him and
went loping down the hill with long, loose strides
like a moose.</p>
<p>Red McWha followed very deliberately with the
teams. He resented anything emotional. And he
was prepared to feel himself aggrieved.</p>
<p>When he reached the cabin door the sound of
weeping had stopped. Inside he found Walley Johnson
on his knees before the stove, hurriedly lighting
a fire. Wrapped in his coat, and clutching his arm
as if afraid he might leave her, stood a tiny, flaxen-haired
child, perhaps five years old. The cabin
was cold, almost as cold as the snapping night
outside. Along the middle of the floor, with bedclothes
from the bunk heaped awkwardly upon it
in the little one&#8217;s efforts to warm it back to responsive
life, sprawled rigidly the lank body of Joe
Godding.</p>
<p>Red McWha stared for a moment in silence, then
stooped, examined the dead man&#8217;s face, and felt his
breast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Deader&#8217;n a herring!&#8221; he muttered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! the poor old shike-poke!&#8221; answered Johnson,
without looking up from his task.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heart?&#8221; queried McWha, laconically.</p>
<p>Johnson made no reply till the flame caught the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
kindling and rushed inwards from the open draught
with a cordial roar. Then he stood up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217; know about that,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But he&#8217;s
been dead these hours and hours! An&#8217; the fire
out! An&#8217; the kid most froze! A sick man like he was,
to&#8217;ve kept the kid alone here with him that way!&#8221;
And he glanced down at the dead figure with severe
reprobation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never was much good, that Joe Godding!&#8221; muttered
McWha, always critical.</p>
<p>As the two woodsmen discussed the situation, the
child, a delicate-featured, blue-eyed girl, was gazing
up from under her mop of bright hair, first at one,
then at the other. Walley Johnson was the one
who had come in answer to her long wailing, who
had hugged her close, and wrapped her up, and
crooned over her in his pity, and driven away the
terrors. But she did not like to look at him, though
his gaunt, sallow face was strong and kind.</p>
<p>People are apt to talk easy generalities about the
intuition of children! As a matter of fact, the
little ones are not above judging quite as superficially
and falsely as their elders. The child looked at her
protector&#8217;s sightless eye, then turned away and
sidled over to McWha with one hand coaxingly
outstretched. McWha&#8217;s mouth twisted sourly.
Without appearing to see the tiny hand, he deftly
evaded it. Stooping over the dead man, he picked
him up, straightened him out decently on his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
bunk, and covered him away from sight with the
blankets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye needn&#8217;t be so crusty to the kid, when she
wants to make up to ye!&#8221; protested Walley, as
the little one turned back to him with a puzzled
look in her tearful blue eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all alike they be, six, or sixteen, or sixty-six!&#8221;
remarked McWha, sarcastically, stepping to
the door. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want none of &#8217;em! Ye kin look
out for &#8217;er! I&#8217;m for the horses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk out so loud,&#8221; admonished the
little one. &#8220;You&#8217;ll wake Daddy. Poor Daddy&#8217;s
sick!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor lamb!&#8221; murmured Johnson, folding her
to his great breast with a pang of pity. &#8220;No; we
won&#8217;t wake daddy. Now tell me, what&#8217;s yer
name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Daddy called me Rosy-Lilly!&#8221; answered the
child, playing with a button on Johnson&#8217;s vest.
&#8220;Is he gettin&#8217; warmer now? He was so cold, and
he wouldn&#8217;t speak to Rosy-Lilly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rosy-Lilly it be!&#8221; agreed Johnson. &#8220;Now we
jest won&#8217;t bother daddy, him bein&#8217; so sick! You an&#8217;
me&#8217;ll git supper.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cabin was warm now, and on tiptoe Johnson
and Rosy-Lilly went about their work, setting
the table, &#8220;bilin&#8217; the tea,&#8221; and frying the bacon.
When Red McWha came in from the barn, and
stamped the snow from his feet, Rosy-Lilly said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
&#8220;Hush!&#8221; laid her finger on her lip, and glanced
meaningly at the moveless shape in the bunk.</p>
<p>&#8220;We mus&#8217; let &#8217;im sleep, Rosy-Lilly says,&#8221; decreed
Johnson, with an emphasis which penetrated McWha&#8217;s
unsympathetic consciousness, and elicited a
non-committal grunt.</p>
<p>When supper was ready, Rosy-Lilly hung around
him for a minute or two before dragging her chair
up to the table. She evidently purposed paying
him the compliment of sitting close beside him and
letting him cut her bacon for her. But finding that
he would not even glance at her, she fetched a deep
sigh, and took her place beside Johnson. When
the meal was over and the dishes had been washed
up, she let Johnson put her to bed in her little bunk
behind the stove. She wanted to kiss her father
for good-night, as usual; but when Johnson insisted
that to do so might wake him up, and be bad for
him, she yielded tearfully; and they heard her
sobbing herself to sleep.</p>
<p>For nearly an hour the two men smoked in silence,
their steaming feet under the stove, their backs
turned towards the long, unstirring shape in the
big bunk. At last Johnson stood up and shook
himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he drawled, &#8220;I s&#8217;pose we mus&#8217; be doin&#8217;
the best we kin fer poor old Joe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He ain&#8217;t left us no ch&#8217;ice!&#8221; snapped McWha.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t leave him here in the house,&#8221; continued
Johnson, irresolutely.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; answered McWha. &#8220;He&#8217;d ha&#8217;nt it,
an&#8217; us, too, ever after, like as not. We got to give
&#8217;im lumberman&#8217;s shift, till the Boss kin send and
take &#8217;im back to the Settlement for the parson to do
&#8217;im up right an&#8217; proper.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they rolled poor Joe Godding up in one of the
tarpaulins which covered the sleds, and buried him
deep in the snow, under the big elm behind the cabin,
and piled a monument of cordwood above him, so
that the foxes and wild cats could not disturb his
lonely sleep, and surmounted the pile with a rude
cross to signify its character. Then, with lighter
hearts, they went back to the cabin fire, which
seemed to burn more freely now that the grim
presence of its former master had been removed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now what&#8217;s to be done with the kid&ndash;&ndash;with
Rosy-Lilly?&#8221; began Johnson.</p>
<p>Red McWha took his pipe from his mouth, and
spat accurately into the crack of the grate to signify
that he had no opinion on that important subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;They do say in the Settlements as how Joe Godding
hain&#8217;t kith nor kin in the world, savin&#8217; an&#8217;
exceptin&#8217; the kid only,&#8221; continued Johnson.</p>
<p>McWha nodded indifferently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; went on Johnson, &#8220;we can&#8217;t do nawthin&#8217;
but take her on to the camp now. Mebbe the Boss&#8217;ll
decide she&#8217;s got to go back to the Settlement, along
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
o&#8217; the fun&#8217;ral. But mebbe he&#8217;ll let the hands keep
her, to kinder chipper up the camp when things gits
dull. I reckon when the boys sees her sweet face
they&#8217;ll all be wantin&#8217; to be guardeens to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>McWha again spat accurately into the crack of the
grate.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t got no fancy for young &#8217;uns in camp,
but ye kin do ez ye like, Walley Johnson,&#8221; he answered
grudgingly. &#8220;Only I want it understood,
right now, I ain&#8217;t no guardeen, an&#8217; won&#8217;t be, to nawthin&#8217;
that walks in petticoats! What I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217;
of is the old cow out yonder, an&#8217; them hens o&#8217; Joe&#8217;s
what I seen a-roostin&#8217; over the cowstall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Them&#8217;s all Rosy-Lilly&#8217;s, an&#8217; goes with us an&#8217;
her to camp to-morrer,&#8221; answered Johnson with
decision. &#8220;We&#8217;ll tell the kid as how her daddy
had to be took away in the night because he was
so sick, an&#8217; couldn&#8217;t speak to nobody, an&#8217; we was
goin&#8217; to take keer o&#8217; her till he gits back! An&#8217;
that&#8217;s the truth,&#8221; he added, with a sudden passion
of tenderness and pity in his tone.</p>
<p>At this hint of emotion McWha laughed sarcastically.
Then knocking out his pipe, he proceeded
to fill the stove for the night, and spread his
blanket on the floor beside it.</p>
<p>&#8220;If ye wants to make the camp a baby-farm,&#8221;
he growled, &#8220;don&#8217;t mind me!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></p>
<p style='text-align:center; margin:1em auto 1.5em auto;'>II</p>
<p>Under the dominion of Rosy-Lilly fell Conroy&#8217;s
camp at sight, capitulating unconditionally to
the first appeal of her tearful blue eyes, and little,
hurt red mouth. Dan Logan, the Boss, happened
to know just how utterly alone the death of her
father had left the child, and he was the first to
propose that the camp should adopt her. Fully
bearing out the faith which Walley Johnson had so
confidently expressed back in the dead man&#8217;s cabin,
Jimmy Brackett, the cook, on whom would necessarily
devolve the chief care of this new member
of his family, jumped to the proposal of the Boss
with enthusiastic support.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll every mother&#8217;s son o&#8217; us be guardeen
to her!&#8221; he declared, with the finality appropriate
to his office as autocrat second only to the Boss
himself. Every man in camp assented noisily,
saving only Red McWha; and he, as was expected
of him, sat back and grinned.</p>
<p>From the first, Rosy-Lilly made herself at home
in the camp. For a few days she fretted after her
father, whenever she was left for a moment to her
own devices; but Jimmy Brackett was ever on
hand to divert her mind with astounding fairy-tales
during the hours when the rest of the hands
were away chopping and hauling. Long after she
had forgotten to fret, she would have little &#8220;cryin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
spells&#8221; at night, remembering her father&#8217;s good-night
kiss. But a baby&#8217;s sorrow, happily, is
shorter than its remembrance; and Rosy-Lilly soon
learned to repeat her phrase: &#8220;Poor Daddy had
to go &#8217;way-&#8217;way-off,&#8221; without the quivering lip and
wistful look which made the big woodsmen&#8217;s hearts
tighten so painfully beneath their homespun shirts.
Conroy&#8217;s Camp was a spacious, oblong cabin of
&#8220;chinked&#8221; logs, with a big stove in the middle.
The bunks were arranged in a double tier along one
wall, and a plank table (rude, but massive) along
the other. Built on at one end, beside the door, was
the kitchen, or cookhouse, crowded, but clean and
orderly, and bright with shining tins. At the inner
end of the main room a corner was boarded off
to make a tiny bedroom, no bigger than a cupboard.
This was the Boss&#8217;s private apartment. It contained
two narrow bunks&ndash;&ndash;one for the Boss himself,
who looked much too big for it; and one for the
only guest whom the camp ever expected to entertain,
the devoted missionary-priest, who, on his snowshoes,
was wont to make the round of the widely
scattered camps once or twice in a winter. This
guest-bunk the Boss at once allotted to Rosy-Lilly,
but on the strict condition that Johnson
should continue to act as nurse and superintend
Rosy-Lilly&#8217;s nightly toilet.</p>
<p>Rosy-Lilly had not been in the camp a week
before McWha&#8217;s &#8220;ugliness&#8221; to her had aroused
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
even the Boss&#8217;s resentment, and the Boss was a
just man. Of course, it was generally recognized
that McWha was not bound, by any law or obligation,
to take any notice of the child, still less to &#8220;make
a fuss over her,&#8221; with the rest of the camp. But
Jimmy Brackett expressed the popular sentiment
when he growled, looking sourly at the back of
McWha&#8217;s unconscious red head bowed ravenously
over his plate of beans&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;If only he&#8217;d <i>do</i> something, so&#8217;s we c&#8217;ld <i>lick</i>
some decency inter &#8217;im!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was absolutely nothing to be done about
it, however; for Red McWha was utterly within
his rights.</p>
<p>Rosy-Lilly, as we have seen, was not yet five
years old; but certain of the characteristics of her
sex were already well developed within her. The
adulation of the rest of the camp, poured out at her
tiny feet, she took graciously enough, but rather as a
matter of course. It was all her due. But what
she wanted was that that big, ugly, red-headed man,
with the cross grey eyes and loud voice, should be
nice to her. She wanted <i>him</i> to pick her up, and
set her on his knee, and whittle wonderful wooden
dogs and dolls and boats and boxes for her with
his jack-knife, as Walley Johnson and the others
did. With Walley she would hardly condescend
to coquet, so sure she was of his abject slavery to
her whims; and, moreover, as must be confessed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
with regret, so unforgiving was she in her heart
toward his blank eye. She merely consented to
make him useful, much as she might a convenient
and altogether doting but uninteresting grandmother.
To all the other members of the camp&ndash;&ndash;except
the Boss, whom she regarded with some
awe&ndash;&ndash;she would make baby-love impartially and
carelessly. But it was Red McWha whose notice
she craved.</p>
<p>When supper was over, and pipes filled and
lighted, some one would strike up a &#8220;chantey&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;one
of those interminable, monotonous ballad-songs
which are peculiar to the lumber camps.</p>
<p>These &#8220;chanteys,&#8221; however robust their wordings
or their incidents, are always sung in a plaintive
minor which goes oddly with the large-moulded
virility of the singers. Some are sentimental, or
religious, to the last degree, while others reek with
an indecency of speech that would shroud the
Tenderloin in blushes. Both kinds are equally
popular in the camps, and both are of the most
astounding <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i>. Of the worst of them, even,
the simple-minded woodsmen are not in the least
ashamed. They seem unconscious of their enormity.
Nevertheless, it came about that, without a word
said by any one, from the hour of Rosy-Lilly&#8217;s
arrival in camp, all the indecent &#8220;chanteys&#8221;
were dropped, as if into oblivion, from the woodsmen&#8217;s
repertoire.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>During the songs, the smoking, and the lazy
fun, Rosy-Lilly would slip from one big woodsman
to another, an inconspicuous little figure in the
smoke-gloomed light of the two oil-lamps. Man
after man would snatch her up to his knee, lay
by his pipe, twist her silky, yellow curls about his
great blunt fingers, and whisper wood-folk tales
or baby nonsense into her pink little ear. She
would listen solemnly for a minute or two, then
wriggle down and move on to another of her admirers.
But before long she would be standing by the bench
on which sat Red McWha, with one big knee usually
hooked high above the other, and his broad back
reclined against the edge of a bunk. For a few
minutes the child would stand there smiling with a
perennial confidence, waiting to be noticed. Then
she would come closer, without a word from her
usually nimble little tongue, lean against McWha&#8217;s
knee, and look up coaxingly into his face. If
McWha chanced to be singing, for he was a &#8220;chanter&#8221;
of some note, he would appear so utterly absorbed
that Rosy-Lilly would at last slip away, with a
look of hurt surprise in her face, to be comforted
by one of her faithful. But if McWha were not
engrossed in song, it would soon become impossible
for him to ignore her. He would suddenly look
down at her with his fierce eyes, knit his shaggy
red brows, and demand harshly: &#8220;Well, Yaller Top,
an&#8217; what d&#8217;<i>you</i> want?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></p>
<p>From the loud voice and angry eye the child
would retreat in haste, clear to the other end of the
room, and sometimes a big tear would track its way
down either cheek. After such an experiment
she would usually seek Jimmy Brackett, who would
console her with some sticky sweetmeat, and strive
to wither McWha with envenomed glances. McWha
would reply with a grin, as if proud of having
routed the little adventurer so easily. He had
discovered that the name &#8220;Yaller Top&#8221; was an
infallible weapon of rebuff, as Rosy-Lilly considered
it a term of indignity. To his evil humour
there was something amusing in abashing Rosy-Lilly
with the title she most disliked. Moreover,
it was an indirect rebuke to the &#8220;saft&#8221; way the
others acted about her.</p>
<p>If Rosy-Lilly felt rebuffed for the moment by
McWha&#8217;s rudeness, she seemed always to forget it
the next time she saw him. Night after night she
would sidle up to his knee, and sue for his notice;
and night after night she would retire discomfited.
But on one occasion the discomfiture was McWha&#8217;s.
She had elicited the customary rough demand&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Yaller Top, what d&#8217;<i>you</i> want?&#8221;</p>
<p>But this time she held her ground, though with
quivering lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yaller Top ain&#8217;t my name &#8217;tall,&#8221; she explained
with baby politeness. &#8220;It&#8217;s Rosy-Lilly; &#8217;n&#8217; I jes&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
thought you <i>might</i> want me to sit on yer knee a
little, teeny minit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Much taken aback, McWha glanced about the
room with a loutish grin. Then he flushed angrily,
as he felt the demand of the sudden silence. Looking
down again, with a scowl, at the expectant
little face of Rosy-Lilly, he growled: &#8220;Well, not
as I knows of!&#8221; and rose to his feet, thrusting
her brusquely aside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t he uglier&#8217;n hell?&#8221; murmured Bird Pigeon
to Walley Johnson, spitting indignantly on the stove-leg.
&#8220;He&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; cuffed the kid ef he da&#8217;st, he glared
at her that ugly!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like to see &#8217;im try it!&#8221; responded Johnson
through his teeth, with a look to which his blank
eye lent mysterious menace.</p>
<p>The time soon came, however, when McWha resumed
his old seat and his old attitude on the
bench. Rosy-Lilly avoided him for two evenings,
but on the third the old fascination got the better
of her pique. McWha saw her coming, and, growing
self-conscious, he hurriedly started up a song with
the full strength of his big voice.</p>
<p>The song was a well-known one, and nothing in
it to redden the ear of a maiden; but it was
profane with that rich, ingenious amplitude of
profanity which seems almost instinctive among
the lumbermen&ndash;&ndash;a sort of second mother-tongue to
them. Had it been any one but McWha who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
started it, nothing would have been said; but, as it
was, Walley Johnson took alarm on the instant.
To his supersensitive watchfulness, McWha was
singing that song &#8220;jest a purpose to be ugly to
the kid.&#8221; The fact that &#8220;the kid&#8221; would hardly
understand a word of it, did not occur to him.
Rising up from his bench behind the stove he
shouted out across the smoky room: &#8220;Shet up
that, Red!&#8221;</p>
<p>The song stopped. Every one looked inquiringly
at Johnson. For several moments there was silence,
broken only by an uneasy shuffling of feet. Then
McWha got up slowly, his eyebrows bristling, his
angry eyes little pin-points. First he addressed
himself to Johnson.</p>
<p>&#8220;What the &ndash;&ndash;&ndash; business is&#8217;t o&#8217; yourn what I
sing?&#8221; he demanded, opening and shutting his big
fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show ye what,&#8221; began Johnson, in a tense
voice. But the Boss interrupted. Dave Logan
was a quiet man, but he ruled his camp. Moreover,
he was a just man, and Johnson had begun the
dispute.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chuck that, Walley!&#8221; he snapped, sharp as a
whip. &#8220;If there&#8217;s to be any row in this here camp,
I&#8217;ll make it myself, an&#8217; don&#8217;t none o&#8217; you boys forgit
it!&#8221;</p>
<p>McWha turned upon him in angry appeal.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re Boss, Dave Logan, an&#8217; what you sez goes,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
fer&#8217;s I&#8217;m concerned,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But I ax you, <i>as</i>
Boss, be this here camp a <i>camp</i>, er a camp-meetin&#8217;?
Walley Johnson kin go straight to hell;
but ef <i>you</i> sez we &#8217;ain&#8217;t to sing nawthin&#8217; but hymns,
why, o&#8217; course, it&#8217;s hymns for me&ndash;&ndash;till I kin git
away to a camp where the hands is men, an&#8217; not
wet-nurses!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, Red!&#8221; said the Boss. &#8220;I
kin make allowances for yer gittin&#8217; riled, considerin&#8217;
the jolt Walley&#8217;s rude interruption give ye! He
hadn&#8217;t no right to interrupt, nor no call to. This
ain&#8217;t no camp-meetin&#8217;. The boys have a right
to swear all they like. Why, &#8217;twouldn&#8217;t be noways
natural in camp ef the boys couldn&#8217;t swear!
somethin&#8217;d hev to bust before long. An&#8217; the boys
can&#8217;t be expected to go a-tiptoe and talk prunes an&#8217;
prisms, all along o&#8217; a little yaller-haired kid what&#8217;s
come to brighten up the old camp fer us. That
wouldn&#8217;t be sense! But all we&#8217;ve got to mind is
jest this&ndash;&ndash;<i>nothin&#8217; vile!</i> That&#8217;s all, boys. We&#8217;ll
worry along without that!&#8221;</p>
<p>When the Boss spoke, he liked to explain himself
rather fully. When he ceased, no one had a word
to say. Every one was satisfied but Johnson;
and he was constrained to seem so. There was an
oppressive silence for some seconds. It was broken
by the soft treble of Rosy-Lilly, who had been
standing before the Boss and gazing up into his
face with awed attention throughout the harangue.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What did you say, Dave?&#8221; she piped, her hands
clasped behind her back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Somethin&#8217; as shall never tech you, Rosy-Lilly!&#8221;
declared Johnson, snatching up the child and
bearing her off to bed, amid a roar of laughter
which saved Dave Logan the embarrassment of a
reply.</p>
<p>For a time, now, Rosy-Lilly left McWha alone, so
markedly that it looked as if Walley Johnson or
Jimmy Brackett had admonished her on the subject.
She continued, indeed, to cast at him eyes of pleading
reproach, but always from a distance, and such appeals
rolled off McWha&#8217;s crude perception like water
off a musk rat&#8217;s fur. He had nothing &#8220;agin her,&#8221;
as he would have put it, if only she would keep out
of his way. But Rosy-Lilly, true to her sex, was
not vanquished by any means, or even discouraged.
She was only biding her time. Bird Pigeon, who
was something of a beau in the Settlements, understood
this, and stirred the loyal wrath of Walley
Johnson by saying so.</p>
<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t nawthin&#8217; about Red McWha to
make Rosy-Lilly keer shucks fer &#8217;im, savin&#8217; an&#8217; except
that she can&#8217;t git him!&#8221; said Bird. &#8220;She&#8217;s
that nigh bein&#8217; a woman a&#8217;ready, if she <i>be</i> but five
year old!&#8221;</p>
<p>Johnson fixed him with his disconcerting eye, and
retorted witheringly&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye thinks ye knows a pile about women, Bird
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
Pigeon. But the kind ye knows about ain&#8217;t the
kind Rosy-Lilly&#8217;s agoin&#8217; to be!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nearly a week went by before Rosy-Lilly saw
another chance to assail McWha&#8217;s forbidding
defences. This time she made what her innocent
heart conceived to be a tremendous bid for the
bad-tempered woodsman&#8217;s favour. Incidentally, too,
she revealed a secret which the Boss and Walley
Johnson had been guarding with guilty solicitude
ever since her coming to the camp.</p>
<p>It chanced that the Boss and Johnson together
were kept away from camp one night till next morning,
laying out a new &#8220;landing&#8221; over on Fork&#8217;s
Brook. When it came time for Rosy-Lilly to be
put to bed, the honour fell, as a matter of course, to
Jimmy Brackett. Rosy-Lilly went with him willingly
enough, but not till after a moment of hesitation, in
which her eyes wandered involuntarily to the
broad, red face of McWha behind its cloud of smoke.</p>
<p>As a nursemaid, Jimmy Brackett flattered himself
that he was a success&ndash;&ndash;till the moment came
when Rosy-Lilly was to be tucked into her bunk.
Then she stood and eyed him with solemn question.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong, me honey-bug?&#8221; asked Brackett,
anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;You hain&#8217;t heard me my prayers!&#8221; replied
Rosy-Lilly, with a touch of severity in her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh? What&#8217;s that?&#8221; stammered Brackett,
startled quite out of his wonted composure.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know little girls has to say their
prayers afore they goes to bed?&#8221; she demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; admitted Brackett, truthfully, wondering
how he was going to get out of the unexpected
situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Walley Johnson hears me mine!&#8221; continued
the child, her eyes very wide open as she weighed
Brackett&#8217;s qualifications in her merciless little
balance.</p>
<p>Here, Brackett was misguided enough to grin,
bethinking him that now he &#8220;had the laugh&#8221; on
the Boss and Walley. That grin settled it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I dess you don&#8217;t know how to hear me say
&#8217;em, Jimmy!&#8221; she announced inexorably. And
picking up the skirt of her blue homespun &#8220;nightie,&#8221;
so that she showed her little red woollen socks and
white deer-hide moccasins, she tripped forth into
the big, noisy room.</p>
<p>At the bright picture she made, her flax-gold hair
tied in a knob on top of her head that it might not
get tangled, the room fell silent instantly, and
every eye was turned upon her. Nothing abashed
by the scrutiny, she made her way sedately down
the room and across to McWha&#8217;s bench. Unable
to ignore her, and angry at the consciousness that
he was embarrassed, McWha eyed her with a grim
stare. But Rosy-Lilly put out her hands to him
confidingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to let you hear me my prayers,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
she said, her clear, baby voice carrying every syllable
to the furthest corner of the room.</p>
<p>An ugly light flamed into McWha&#8217;s eyes, and he
sprang to his feet, brushing the child rudely aside.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s some o&#8217; Jimmy Brackett&#8217;s work!&#8221; he
shouted. &#8220;It&#8217;s him put &#8217;er up to it, curse him!&#8221;</p>
<p>The whole room burst into a roar of laughter at
the sight of his wrath. Snatching his cap from
its peg, he strode furiously out to the stable, slamming
the door behind him.</p>
<p>In their delight over McWha&#8217;s discomfiture the
woodsmen quite forgot the feelings of Rosy-Lilly.
For a second or two she stood motionless, her lips
and eyes wide open with amazement. Then, hurt
as much by the laughter of the room as by McWha&#8217;s
rebuff, she burst into tears, and stood hiding her
face with both hands, the picture of desolation.</p>
<p>When the men realized that she thought they were
laughing at her, they shut their mouths with amazing
promptitude, and crowded about her. One after
another picked her up, striving to console her with
caresses and extravagant promises. She would not
uncover her eyes, however, for any one, and her
heart-broken wailing was not hushed till Brackett
thrust his way through the crowd, growling inarticulate
blasphemies at them all, and bore her back
to her room. When he emerged twenty minutes
later no one asked him about Rosy-Lilly&#8217;s prayers.
As for Rosy-Lilly, her feelings were this time so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
outraged that she would no longer look at McWha.</p>
<p style='text-align:center; margin:1em auto 1.5em auto;'>III</p>
<p>The long backwoods winter was now drawing near
its end, and the snow in the open spaces was getting
so soft at midday as to slump heavily and hinder
the work of the teams. Every one was working with
feverish haste to get the logs all out to the &#8220;landings,&#8221;
on the river banks before the hauling should
go to pieces. At night the tired lumbermen would
tumble into their bunks as soon as supper was over,
too greedy of sleep to think of songs or yarns. And
Rosy-Lilly began to feel a little aggrieved at the inadequate
attention which she was now receiving from
all but Jimmy Brackett and the ever-faithful
Johnson. She began to forgive McWha, and once
more to try her baby wiles upon him. But McWha
was as coldly unconscious as a stone.</p>
<p>One day, however, Fate concluded to range herself
on Rosy-Lilly&#8217;s side. A dead branch, hurled
through the air by the impact of a falling tree,
struck Red McWha on the head, and he was carried
home to the cabin unconscious, bleeding from a long
gash in his scalp. The Boss, something of a surgeon
in his rough and ready way, as bosses need to be,
washed the wound and sewed it up. Then he handed
over his own bunk to the wounded man, declaring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
optimistically that McWha would come round all
right, his breed being hard to kill.</p>
<p>It was hours later when McWha began to recover
consciousness, and just then, as it happened, there
was no one near him but Rosy-Lilly. Smitten
with pity, the child was standing beside the bunk,
murmuring: &#8220;Poor! poor! I so sorry!&#8221; and slowly
shaking her head and lightly patting the big, limp
hand where it lay outside the blanket.</p>
<p>McWha half opened his eyes, and their faint
glance fell on the top of Rosy-Lilly&#8217;s head as she
bent over his hand. With a wry smile he shut
them again, but to his surprise, he felt rather
gratified. Then Jimmy Brackett came in and
whisked the child away. &#8220;&#8217;S if he thought I&#8217;d
bite &#8217;er!&#8221; mused McWha, somewhat inconsistently.</p>
<p>For a long time he lay wondering confusedly. At
last he opened his eyes wide, felt his bandaged head,
and called for a drink of water in a voice which he
vainly strove to make sound natural. To his surprise
he was answered by Rosy-Lilly, so promptly
that it was as if she had been listening for his voice.
She came carrying the tin of water in both little
hands, and, lifting it very carefully, she tried to
hold it to his lips. Neither she nor McWha was
quite successful in this, however. While they were
fumbling over it, Jimmy Brackett hurried in, followed
by the Boss, and Rosy-Lilly&#8217;s nursing was
superseded. The Boss had to hold him up so that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
he could drink; and when he had feverishly gulped
about a quart, he lay back on his pillow with a huge
sigh, declaring weakly that he was all right.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye got off mighty easy, Red,&#8221; said the Boss,
cheerfully, &#8220;considerin&#8217; the heft o&#8217; the knot &#8217;at hit
ye. But you McWhas was always hard to kill.&#8221;</p>
<p>McWha&#8217;s hand was drooping loosely over the
edge of the bunk. He felt the child&#8217;s tiny fingers
brushing it again softly and tenderly. Then he
felt her lips upon it, and the sensation was so novel
that he quite forgot to reply to the Boss&#8217;s pleasantry.</p>
<p>That night McWha was so much better that
when he insisted on being removed to his own bunk
on the plea that he &#8220;didn&#8217;t feel at home in a cupboard
like,&#8221; the Boss consented. Next day he
wanted to go back to work, but the Boss was derisively
inexorable, and for two days McWha was
kept a prisoner.</p>
<p>During this time Jimmy Brackett, with severe
and detailed admonition, kept Rosy-Lilly from
again obtruding upon the patient&#8217;s leisure; and
McWha had nothing to do but smoke and whittle.
He whittled diligently, but let no one see what he
was making. Then, borrowing a small tin cup from
the cook, he fussed over the stove with some dark,
smelly decoction of tobacco-juice and ink. Rosy-Lilly
was consumed with curiosity, especially when
she saw him apparently digging beads off an Indian
tobacco-pouch which he always carried. But she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
did not go near enough to get enlightened as to his
mysterious occupation.</p>
<p>On the following day McWha went to work again,
but not till after breakfast, when the others had
long departed. Rosy-Lilly, with one hand twisted
in her little apron, was standing in the doorway
as he passed out. She glanced up at him with the
most coaxing smile in her whole armoury of allurements.
McWha would not look at her, and his face
was as sullenly harsh as ever; but as he passed he
slipped something into her hand. To her speechless
delight, it proved to be a little dark-brown wooden
doll, daintily carved, and with two white beads,
with black centres, cunningly set into its face for
eyes.</p>
<p>Rosy-Lilly hugged the treasure to her breast.
Her first proud impulse was to run to Jimmy
Brackett with it. But a subtler instinct withheld
her. The gift had been bestowed in such a surreptitious
way that she felt it to be somehow a kind of
secret. She carried it away and hid it in her bunk,
where she would go and look at it from time to time
throughout the day. That night she brought it forth,
but with several other treasures, so that it quite
escaped comment. She said nothing about it to
McWha, but she played with it when he could not
help seeing it. And thereafter her &#8220;nigger-baby&#8221;
was always in her arms.</p>
<p>This compliment, however, was apparently all lost
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
on McWha, who had again grown unconscious
of her existence. And Rosy-Lilly, on her part, no
longer strove to win his attention. She was content
either with the victory she had won, or with the
secret understanding which, perforce, now existed
between them. And things went on smoothly in
the camp, with every one now too occupied to do
more than mind his own business.</p>
<p>It chanced this year that the spring thaws were
early and unusually swift, warm rains alternating
with hot, searching sunshine which withered and
devoured the snow. The ice went out with a rush
in the rapidly rising Ottanoonsis; and from every
brookside &#8220;landing&#8221; the logs came down in black,
tumbling swarms. Just below Conroy&#8217;s Camp the
river wallowed round a narrow bend, tangled with
slate ledges. It was a nasty place enough at low
water, but in freshet a roaring terror to all the river-men.
When the logs were running in any numbers,
the bend had to be watched with vigilance lest a
jam should form, and the waters be dammed back,
and the lumber get &#8220;hung up&#8221; all over the swamps
of the upper reaches.</p>
<p>And here, now, in spite of the frantic efforts of
Dave Logan and his crew, the logs suddenly began
to jam. Pitching downward as if propelled by a
pile-driver, certain great timbers drove their ends
between the upstanding strata of the slate, and held
against the torrent till others came and wedged them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
securely. The jam began between two ledges in
midstream, where no one could get near it. In a
few minutes the interlocked mass stretched from
bank to bank, with the torrent spurting and spouting
through it in furious milk-white jets. Log after
log was chopped free by the axemen along the shore,
but the mass remained unshaken. Meanwhile the
logs were gathering swiftly behind, ramming down
and solidifying the whole structure, and damming
back the flood till its heavy thunder diminished to
the querulous rattling of a mill-race. In a short
time the river was packed solid from shore to shore
for several hundred yards above the brow of the
jam; and above that again the waters were rising
at a rate which threatened in a few hours to flood
the valley and sweep away the camp itself.</p>
<p>At this stage of affairs the Boss, axe in hand,
picked his way across the monstrous tangle of the
face of the jam between the great white jets, till
he gained the centre of the structure. Here his
practised eye, with the aid of a perilous axe-stroke
here and there,&ndash;&ndash;strokes which might possibly bring
the whole looming mass down upon him in a moment,&ndash;&ndash;presently
located the timbers which held the
structure firm, &#8220;the key-logs,&#8221; as the men call
them. These he marked with his axe. Then, returning
to the shore, he called for two volunteers
to dare the task of cutting these key-logs away.</p>
<p>Such a task is the most perilous that a lumberman,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
in all his daring career, can be called upon to perform.
So perilous is it that it is always left to volunteers.
Dave Logan had some brilliant feats of jam-breaking
to his credit, from the days before he was
made a Boss; and now, when he called for volunteers,
every unmarried man in camp responded,
with the exception, of course, of Walley Johnson,
whose limited vision unfitted him for such a venture.
The Boss chose Bird Pigeon and Andy White, because
they were not only &#8220;smart&#8221; axemen, but
also adepts in the river-men&#8217;s games of &#8220;running
logs.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a jaunty air the two young men spat on
their hands, gripped their axes, and sprang out
along the base of the jam. Every eye in camp was
fixed upon them with a fearful interest as they plied
their heavy blades. It was heroic, of a magnificence
of valour seldom equalled on any field, the work
of these two, chopping coolly out there in the daunting
tumult, under that colossal front of death.
Their duty was nothing less than to bring the toppling
brow of the jam down upon them, yet cheat
Fate at the last instant, if possible, by leaping to
shore before the chaos quite overwhelmed them.</p>
<p>Suddenly, while the two key-logs were not yet
half cut through, the trained eye of the Boss detected
a settling near the top of the jam. His yell
of warning tore through the clamour of the waters.
At the instant came a vast grumbling, like underground
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
thunder, not loud apparently, yet dulling
all other sounds. The two choppers sprang wildly
for shore, as the whole face of the jam seemed to
crumble in a breath.</p>
<p>At this moment a scream of terror was heard&ndash;&ndash;and
every heart stopped. Some thirty yards or so
upstream, and a dozen, perhaps, from shore, stood
Rosy-Lilly, on a log. While none were observing
her she had gleefully clambered out over the solid
mass, looking for spruce-gums. But now, when
the logs moved, she was so terror-stricken that she
could not even try to get ashore. She just fell
down upon her log, and clung to it, screaming.</p>
<p>A groan of horror went up. The awful grinding
of the break-up was already under way. To every
trained eye it was evident that there was no human
possibility of reaching the child, much less of saving
her. To attempt it would be such a madness as to
jump into the hopper of a mill. The crowd surged
to the edge&ndash;&ndash;and sprang back as the nearest logs
bounded up at them. Except Walley Johnson.
He leaped wildly out upon the nearest logs, fell
headforemost, and was dragged back, fighting
furiously, by a dozen inexorable hands.</p>
<p>Just as Johnson went down, there arose a great
bellowing cry of rage and anguish; then Red McWha&#8217;s
big form shot past, leaping far out upon the logs.
Over the sickening upheaval he bounded this way
and that, with miraculous sure-footedness. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
reached the pitching log whereon Rosy-Lilly still
clung. He clutched her by the frock. He tucked
her under one arm like a rag-baby. Then he turned,
balancing himself for an instant, and came leaping
back towards shore.</p>
<p>A great shout of wonder and joy went up&ndash;&ndash;to be
hushed in a second as a log reared high in McWha&#8217;s
path and hurled him backwards. Right down into
the whirl of the dreadful grist he sank. But with
a strength that seemed more than human he recovered
himself, climbed forth dripping, and came
on again with those great, unerring leaps. This
time there was no shout. The men waited with
dry throats. They saw that his ruddy face had gone
white as chalk. Within two feet of shore a log toward
which he had jumped was jerked aside just
before he reached it, and, turning in the air as he
fell, so as to save the child, he came down across
it on his side with stunning violence. As he fell
the Boss and Brackett and two of the others sprang
out to meet him. They reached him somehow,
and covered with bruises which they did not feel,
succeeded in dragging him, with his precious burden,
up from the grinding hell to safety. When his
feet touched solid ground he sank unconscious, but
with his arm so securely gripped about the child
that they had difficulty in loosing his hold.</p>
<p>Rosy-Lilly, when they picked her up, was quivering
with terror, but unharmed. When she saw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
McWha stretched out upon the bank motionless,
with his eyes shut and his white lips half open, she
fought savagely to be put down. She ran and flung
herself down beside her rescuer, caught his big white
face between her tiny hands, and fell to kissing him.
Presently McWha opened his eyes, and with a
mighty effort rose upon one elbow. A look of
embarrassment passed over his face as he glanced
at the men standing about him. Then he looked
down at Rosy-Lilly, grinned with a shamefaced
tenderness, and pulled her gently towards him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m right&ndash;&ndash;glad&ndash;&ndash;ye&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he began with painful
effort. But before he could complete the sentence
his eyes changed, and he fell back with a clicking
gasp.</p>
<p>Jimmy Brackett, heedless of her wailing protests,
snatched up Rosy-Lilly, and carried her back to the
camp.</p>

<h2><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Melindy and the Lynxes</span></h2>
</div>
<p>The deep, slow-gathering snows of mid-February
had buried away every stump in the pasture
lot and muffled from sight all the zigzag fences of
the little lonely clearing. The Settlement road was
simply smoothed out of existence. The log cabin,
with its low roof and one chimney, seemed half
sunken in the snow which piled itself over the lower
panes of its three tiny windows.</p>
<p>The log barn, and the lean-to, which served as
wood-shed and wagon-house, showed little more than
the black edges of their snow-covered roofs over the
glittering and gently billowing white expanse.</p>
<p>In the middle of the yard the little well-house,
shaped like the top of a &#8220;grandfather&#8217;s clock,&#8221; carried
a thick, white, crusted cap, and was encircled with a
streaky, irregular mass of ice, which had gradually
accumulated almost up to the brim of the watering-trough.
From the cabin door to the door of the
barn, and over most of the yard space, but particularly
in front of the sunward-facing lean-to, the
snow was trodden down and littered with chips and
straw.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span></p>
<p>Here in the mocking sunshine huddled four white
sheep, while half a dozen hens and a red Shanghai
cock scratched in the litter beside them. The low
door of the barn was tightly closed to protect the cow
and horse from the bitter cold&ndash;&ndash;which the sheep,
with their great fleeces, did not seem to mind.</p>
<p>Inside the cabin, where an old-fashioned, high-ovened
kitchen stove, heated to the point where a
dull red glow began to show itself in spots, kept the
close air at summer temperature, a slim girl with
fluffy, light hair and pale complexion stood by the
table, vigorously mixing a batter of buckwheat
flour for pancakes. Her slender young arms were
streaked with flour, as was her forehead also, from
her frequent efforts to brush her hair out of her eyes
by quick upward dashes of her forearm.</p>
<p>On the other side of the stove, so close to it that
her rugged face was reddened by the heat, sat a
massive old woman in a heavy rocking-chair, knitting.
She knitted impetuously, impatiently, as if
resenting the employment of her vigorous old fingers
upon so mild a task.</p>
<p>Through a clear space in one pane of the window
beside her&ndash;&ndash;a space where the heat within had triumphed
over the frost without&ndash;&ndash;she cast restless,
keen eyes out across the yard to the place where the
road, the one link between the cabin and the settlement,
lay smothered from sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one week to-day, Melindy,&#8221; she announced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
in a voice of accusing indignation, &#8220;since there&#8217;s
been a team got through; and it&#8217;s going to be another
before they&#8217;ll get the road broke out!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like as not, Granny,&#8221; responded the girl, beating
the batter with an impatience that belied the cheerfulness
of her tone. &#8220;But what does it matter,
anyway? We&#8217;re all right here for a month!&#8221;</p>
<p>As she spoke, however, her eyes, too, gazed out
wistfully over the buried road. She was wearying
for the sound of bells and for a drive into
the Settlement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, from the edge of the woods on the
other side of the cabin, hidden from the keen eyes
within by the roofs of the barn and the shed, came
two great, grey, catlike beasts, creeping belly to the
snow.</p>
<p>Their broad, soft-padded paws were like snow
shoes, bearing them up on the wind-packed surface.
Their tufted ears stood straight up, alert for any
unwonted sound. Their absurd stub tails, not four
inches long, and looking as if they had been bitten
off, twitched with eagerness. Their big round eyes,
of a pale greenish yellow, and with the pupils narrowed
to upright, threadlike black slits by the
blinding glare, glanced warily from side to side
with every step they took.</p>
<p>The lynxes had the keenest dislike to crossing the
open pasture in this broad daylight, but they had
been driven by hunger to the point where the customs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
and cautions of their wary kind are recklessly thrown
aside. Hunger had driven the pair to hunt together,
in the hope of together pulling down game too powerful
for one to master alone. Hunger had overcome
their savage aversion to the neighbourhood of man,
and brought them out in the dark of night to prowl
about the barn and sniff longingly the warm smell
of the sheep, steaming through the cracks of the
clumsy door.</p>
<p>Watching from under the snow-draped branches,
they had observed that only in the daytime were the
sheep let out from their safe shelter behind the clumsy
door. And now, forgetting everything but the
fierce pangs that urged them, the two savage beasts
came straight down the rolling slope of the pasture
towards the barn.</p>
<p>A few minutes later there came from the yard a
wild screeching and cackling of the hens, followed
by a trampling rush and agonized bleating. The old
woman half rose from her chair, but sank back instantly,
her face creased with a spasm of pain, for
she was crippled by rheumatism. The girl dropped
her big wooden spoon on the floor and rushed to the
window that looked out upon the yard. Her pale
face went paler with horror, then flushed with wrath
and pity; and a fierce light flashed into her wide
blue eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s lynxes!&#8221; she cried, snatching up the wooden
spoon and darting for the door. &#8220;And they&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
got one of the sheep! Oh, oh, they&#8217;re tearing
it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Melindy!&#8221; shouted the old woman, in a voice
of strident command&ndash;&ndash;such a compelling voice that
the girl stopped short in spite of herself. &#8220;Drop
that fool spoon and get the gun!&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl dropped the spoon as if it had burned her
fingers, and looked irresolutely at the big duck-gun
hanging on the log wall. &#8220;I can&#8217;t fire it!&#8221; she exclaimed,
shaking her head. &#8220;I&#8217;d be scared to death
of it!&#8221;</p>
<p>But even as the words left her mouth, there came
another outburst of trampling and frantic clamour
from the yard. She snatched up the little, long-handled
axe which leaned beside the door-post, threw
the door wide open, and with a pitying cry of &#8220;Oh!
oh!&#8221; flew forth to the rescue of her beloved sheep.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever see the like of that?&#8221; muttered
the old woman, her harsh face working with excitement
and high approbation. &#8220;Scairt to death of a
gun&ndash;&ndash;and goes out to fight lynxes all by herself!&#8221;</p>
<p>And with painful effort she began hitching herself
and the big chair across the floor, seeking a position
where she could both reach the gun and command
a view through the wide-open door.</p>
<p>When Melindy, her heart aflame with pity for
the helpless ewes, rushed out into the yard, she
saw one woolly victim down, kicking silently on
the bloodstained snow, while a big lynx, crouched
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
upon its body, turned upon her a pair of pale eyes
that blazed with fury at the interruption to his feast.</p>
<p>The other sheep were foundered helplessly in the
deep snow back of the well&ndash;&ndash;except one. This one,
which had evidently been headed off from the flock,
and driven round to the near side of the watering-trough
before its savage enemy overtook it, was not
half a dozen paces from the cabin door. It was
just stumbling forward upon its nose, with a despairing
<i>baa-a-a!</i> while the second and larger lynx,
clinging upon its back, clutched hungrily for its
throat through the thick, protecting wool.</p>
<p>On ordinary occasions the girl was as timid as
her small, pale face and gentle blue eyes made her
look. At this crisis, however, a sort of fury of compassion
swept all fear from her heart.</p>
<p>Like the swoop of some strange bird, her skirts
streaming behind her, she flung herself upon the
great cat, and aimed a lightning blow at his head
with her axe. In her frail grip the axe turned, so that
the brute caught the flat of it instead of the edge.</p>
<p>Half-stunned, he lost his hold and fell with a
startled <i>pfiff</i> on the snow, while his victim, bleeding,
but not mortally hurt, ran bleating towards the rest
of the flock, where they floundered, stupidly helpless,
in three feet of soft snow.</p>
<p>The next moment the baffled lynx recovered himself,
and faced the girl with so menacing a snarl
that she hesitated to follow up her advantage,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
but paused, holding the axe in readiness to repel
attack.</p>
<p>For a few seconds they faced each other so, the
girl and the beast. Then the pale, beast eyes shifted
under the steady, dominating gaze of the blue
human ones; and at last, with a spitting growl,
which ended in a hoarse screech of rage, the big
cat bounded aside and whisked behind the well-house.
The next moment it was again among
the sheep, where they huddled incapable of a
struggle.</p>
<p>Again the girl sprang to the rescue; and now,
because of that one flash of fear which had deprived
her of her first advantage, her avenging wrath was
fiercer and more resolute than before. This time,
as she darted upon the enemy, she gave an involuntary
cry of rage, piercing and unnatural. At
this unexpected sound the lynx, desperate though
he was with rage and hunger, lost his courage.</p>
<p>Seeing the girl towering almost over him, he
doubled back with a mighty leap, just avoiding the
vengeful sweep of the axe, and darted back to the
front of the shed, where his mate was now ravenously
feasting on her easy prey.</p>
<p>Although the first victim was now past all suffering,
being no more a motive for heroism than so
much mutton, the girl&#8217;s blood was too hot with
triumphant indignation to let her think of such an
unimportant point as that. She was victor. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
had outfaced and routed the foe. She had saved
one victim. She would avenge the other.</p>
<p>With the high audacity of those who have overcome
fear, she now, with a hysterical cry of menace,
ran at the two lynxes, to drive them from their prey.</p>
<p>The situation which she now confronted, however,
was altogether changed from what had gone before.
The two lynxes were together, strong in that alliance
which they had formed for purpose of battle. They
were fairly mad with famine&ndash;&ndash;or, indeed, they
would never have ventured on the perilous domains
of man.</p>
<p>Moreover, they were in possession of what they
held to be their lawful prey&ndash;&ndash;a position in defence
of which all the hunting tribes of the wild will fight
against almost any odds. As they saw their strange
adversary approaching, the hair stood straight up
along their backs, their little tails puffed to bottle
brushes, their ears lay flat back on their heads, and
they screeched defiance in harsh unison. Then, as
if by one impulse, they turned from their prey and
crept stealthily towards her.</p>
<p>They did not like that steady light in her blue eyes,
but they felt by some instinct that she was young
and unstable of nerve. At this unexpected move on
their part the girl stopped short, suddenly undecided
whether to fight or flee.</p>
<p>At once the lynxes stopped also, and crouched
flat, tensely watching, their claws dug deep into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
hard-trodden snow so as to give them purchase for
an instant, powerful spring in any direction.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, the crippled old woman
within doors had not been idle. Great of spirit,
and still mighty of sinew for all her ailment, she
had managed to work the weight of the heavy chair
and her own solid bulk all the way across the cabin
floor. Being straight in front of the door, she had
seen almost all that happened; and her brave
old berserk heart was bursting with pride in the
courage of this frail child, whom she had hitherto
regarded with a kind of affectionate scorn.</p>
<p>The Griffises of Nackawick and Little River
had always been sizable men, men of sinew and bulk,
and women tall and ruddy; and this small, blue-eyed
girl had seemed to her, in a way, to wrong the
stock. But she was quick to understand that the
stature of the spirit is what counts most of
all.</p>
<p>Now, in this moment of breathless suspense, when
she saw Melindy and the two great beasts thus holding
each other eye to eye in a life and death struggle
of wills, her heart was convulsed with a wild fear.
In the spasm of it she succeeded in lifting herself
almost erect, and so gained possession of the big
duck-gun, which her son Jake, now away in the
lumber woods, always kept loaded and ready for
use. As she cocked it and settled back into her
chair, she called in a piercing voice&ndash;&ndash;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t stir one step, Melindy! I&#8217;m going to
shoot!&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl never stirred a muscle, although she
turned pale with terror of the loud noise which was
about to shock her ears. The two lynxes, however,
turned their heads, and fixed the pale glare of their
eyes upon the figure seated in the doorway.</p>
<p>The next moment came a spurt of red flame, a
belch of smoke, a tremendous report that seemed
as if it must have shattered every pane of glass in
the cabin windows. The bigger of the two lynxes
turned straight over backward and lay without a
quiver, smashed by the heavy charge of buckshot
with which Jake had loaded the gun. The other,
grazed by a scattering pellet, sprang into the air
with a screech, then turned and ran for her life
across the snow, stretching out like a terrified cat.</p>
<p>With a proud smile the old woman stood the
smoking gun against the wall and straightened her
cap. For perhaps half a minute Melindy stood
rigid, staring at the dead lynx. Then, dropping her
axe, she fled to the cabin, flung herself down with
her face in her grandmother&#8217;s lap, and broke into a
storm of sobs.</p>
<p>The old woman gazed down upon her with some
surprise, and stroked the fair, fluffy head lovingly as
she murmured: &#8220;There, there! There&#8217;s nothing to
take on about! Though you be such a little mite
of a towhead, you&#8217;ve got the grit, you&#8217;ve got the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
grit, Melindy Griffis. It&#8217;s proud of you I am, and it&#8217;s
proud your father&#8217;ll be when I tell him about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, as the girl&#8217;s weeping continued, and her
slender shoulders continued to twist with her sobs,
the rugged old face that bent above her grew tenderly
solicitous.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, there!&#8221; she murmured again. &#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t
good for you to take on so, deary. Hadn&#8217;t you better
finish beating up the pancakes before the batter
spiles?&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus potently adjured, although she knew as well
as her grandmother that there was no immediate
danger of the batter spoiling, the girl got up, dashed
the back of her hand across her eyes with a little
laugh, closed the door, got out another spoon from
the table drawer, and cheerfully resumed her interrupted
task of mixing pancakes. And the sheep,
having slowly extricated themselves from the deep
snow behind the well-house, huddled together, with
heads down, in the middle of the yard, fearfully eyeing
the limp body which lay before the shed.</p>

<h2><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Mrs. Gammit&#8217;s Pig</span></h2>
</div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come to borry yer gun!&#8221; said Mrs. Gammit,
appearing suddenly, a self-reliant figure,
at the open door of the barn where Joe Barron sat
mending his harness. She wore a short cotton
homespun petticoat and a dingy waist; while a
limp pink cotton sunbonnet, pushed far back from
her perspiring forehead, released unmanageable
tufts of her stiff, iron-grey hair.</p>
<p>&#8220;What be <i>you</i> awantin&#8217; of a gun, Mrs. Gammit?&#8221;
inquired the backwoodsman, looking up without
surprise. He had not seen Mrs. Gammit, to be
sure, for three months; but he had known all the
time that she was there, on the other side of the
ridge, one of his nearest neighbours, and not more
than seven or eight miles away as the crow flies.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the bears!&#8221; she explained. &#8220;They do be
gittin&#8217; jest a leetle mite <i>too</i> sassy, down to my place.
There ain&#8217;t no livin&#8217; with &#8217;em. They come rootin&#8217;
round in the garden, nights. An&#8217; they&#8217;ve et up the
white top-knot hen, with the whole settin&#8217; of eggs,
that was to hev&#8217; hatched out next Monday. An&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
they&#8217;ve took the duck. An&#8217; last night they come
after the pig.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t git <i>him</i>, did they?&#8221; inquired Joe
Barron sympathetically.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, siree!&#8221; responded Mrs. Gammit with decision.
&#8220;An&#8217; they ain&#8217;t agoin&#8217; to! They scairt him
though, snuffin&#8217; round outside the pen, trying to
find the way in.&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ve hearn tell they was powerful
fond of pork.&ndash;&ndash;He set up sich a squealin&#8217; it woke me;
an&#8217; I yelled at &#8217;em out of the winder. I seen
one big black chap lopin&#8217; off behind the barn. I
hadn&#8217;t nothin&#8217; but the broom fer a weapon, so he
got away from me. I&#8217;ll git him to-night, though,
I reckon, if I kin have the loan of your gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sartain,&#8221; assented the woodsman, laying down
the breech-strap he was mending. &#8220;Did you ever
fire a gun?&#8221; he inquired suddenly, as he was starting
across the yard to fetch the weapon from his
cabin.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t rightly say I hev&#8217;,&#8221; answered Mrs. Gammit,
with a slight note of scorn in her voice. &#8220;But
from the kind of men I&#8217;ve seen as <i>kin</i>, I reckon it
ain&#8217;t no great trick to larn.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joe Barron laughed, and went for the weapon.
He had plenty of confidence in his visitor&#8217;s ability to
look out for herself, and felt reasonably sure that
the bears would be sorry for having presumed upon
her unprotected state. When he returned with the
gun&ndash;&ndash;an old, muzzle-loading duck-gun, with a huge
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
bore&ndash;&ndash;she accepted it with careless ease and held
it as if it were a broom. But when he offered her
the powder-horn and a little bag of buckshot, she
hesitated.</p>
<p>&#8220;What be <i>them</i> for?&#8221; she inquired.</p>
<p>Joe Barren looked serious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Gammit,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I know you kin do
most anything a man kin do&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; do it better, maybe!
A woman like you don&#8217;t have to apologize for
nothin&#8217;. But you was not <i>brung up</i> in the woods,
an&#8217; you can&#8217;t expect to know all about a gun jest
by <i>heftin&#8217;</i> it. Folks that&#8217;s been brung up in town,
like you, have to be <i>told</i> how to handle a gun. This
here gun ain&#8217;t <i>loaded</i>. And them &#8217;ere&#8217;s the powder
an&#8217; buckshot to load her with. An&#8217; here&#8217;s caps,&#8221;
he added, producing a small, brown tin box of
percussion caps from his trousers pocket.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gammit felt abashed at her ignorance, but
gratified, at the same time, by the reproach of
metropolitanism. This implication of town-bred
incompetency was most flattering to the seven frame
houses and one corner store of Burd Settlement,
whence she hailed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you&#8217;d better show me how to load the
thing, Mr. Barron,&#8221; she agreed quite humbly. And
her keen grey eyes took in every detail, as the woodsman
rammed home the powder hard, wadded down
the charge of buckshot lightly, and pointed out
where she must put the percussion cap when she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
should be ready to call upon the weapon for its
services.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said he in conclusion, as he lifted the
gun to his shoulder and squinted along the barrel,
&#8220;of course you know all the rest. Jest shet one eye,
an&#8217; git the bead on him fair, an&#8217; let him have it&ndash;&ndash;a
leetle back of the fore-shoulder, fer choice! An&#8217;
<i>that</i> b&#8217;ar ain&#8217;t agoin&#8217; to worry about no more pork,
nor garden sass. An&#8217; recollect, Mrs. Gammit, at
this time of year, when he&#8217;s fat on blueberries,
he&#8217;ll make right prime pork himself, ef he ain&#8217;t <i>too</i>
old and rank.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Mrs. Gammit strode homeward through the
hot, silent woods with the gun&ndash;&ndash;still carrying it as if
it were a broom&ndash;&ndash;she had no misgivings as to her fitness
to confront and master the most redoubtable
of all the forest kindreds. She believed in herself&ndash;&ndash;and
not only her native Burd Settlement, but the
backwoods generally held that she had cause to.
A busy woman always, she had somehow never
found time to indulge in the luxury of a husband;
but the honorary title of &#8220;Mrs.&#8221; had early been conferred
upon her, in recognition of her abundant and
confident personality and her all-round capacity
for taking care of herself. To have called her
&#8220;Miss&#8221; would have been an insult to the fitness of
things. When, at the age of sixty, she inherited
from an only, and strictly bachelor, brother a little
farm in the heart of the wilderness, some forty miles
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
in from the Settlement, no one doubted her ability
to fill the r&ocirc;le of backwoodsman and pioneer. It
was vaguely felt that if the backwoods and Mrs.
Gammit should fail to agree on any important point,
so much the worse for the backwoods.</p>
<p>And indeed, for nearly two years and a half
everything had gone swimmingly. The solitude
had never troubled Mrs. Gammit, to whom her own
company was always congenial&ndash;&ndash;and, as she felt,
the only company that one could depend upon.
Then she had her two young steers, well broken
to the yoke; the spotted cow, with one horn turned
up and the other down; the grey and yellow cat,
with whom she lived on terms of mutual tolerance;
a turkey-cock and two turkey hens, of whom she
expected much; an assortment of fowls, brown,
black, white, red, and speckled; one fat duck,
which had so far been nothing but a disappointment
to her; and the white pig, which was her pride.
No wonder she was never lonely, with all these good
acquaintances to talk to. Moreover, the forces of
the wild, seeming to recognize that she was a woman
who would have her way, had from the first easily
deferred to her. The capricious and incomprehensible
early frosts of the forest region had spared her
precious garden patch; cut-worm and caterpillar
had gone by the other way; the pip had overlooked
her early chickens; and as for the customary
onslaughts of wildcat, weasel, fox, and skunk, she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
had met them all with such triumphant success that
she began to mistake her mere good luck for the
quintessence of woodcraft. In fact, nothing had happened
to challenge her infallibility, nothing whatever,
until she found that the bears were beginning
to concern themselves about her.</p>
<p>To be sure, there was only one bear mixed up in
the matter; but he chanced to be so diligent,
interested, and resourceful, that it was no wonder
he had got himself multiplied many times over in
Mrs. Gammit&#8217;s indignant imagination. When she
told Joe Barron &#8220;that the bears was gittin&#8217; so
sassy there wasn&#8217;t no livin&#8217; with &#8217;em,&#8221; she had little
notion that what she referred to was just one, solitary,
rusty, somewhat moth-eaten animal, crafty
with experience and years. This bear, as it chanced,
had had advantages in the way of education not
often shared by his fellow-roamers of the wilderness.
He had passed several seasons in captivity in one of
the settlements far south of the Quah-Davic Valley.
Afterwards, he had served an unpleasant term in a
flea-ridden travelling menagerie, from which a
railway smash-up had given him release at the
moderate cost of the loss of one eye. During his
captivity he had acquired a profound respect for
men, as creatures who had a tendency to beat him
over the nose and hurt him terribly if he failed to
do as they wished, and who held in eye and voice the
uncomprehended but irresistible authority of fate.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
For women, however, he had learned to entertain a
casual scorn. They screamed when he growled,
and ran away if he stretched out a paw at them.
When, therefore, he had found himself once more
in the vast responsible freedom of the forest, and
reviving with some difficulty the half-forgotten art
of shifting for himself, he had given a wide berth to
the hunters&#8217; shacks and the cabins of lumbermen
and pioneers. But when, on the other hand, he
had come upon Mrs. Gammit&#8217;s clearing, and realized,
after long and cautious investigations, that its presiding
genius was nothing more formidable than
one of those petticoated creatures who trembled
at his growl, he had licked his chops with pleasant
anticipation. Here, at last, was his opportunity,&ndash;&ndash;the
flesh-pots of servitude, with freedom.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the old bear was prudent. He
would not presume too quickly, or too far, upon the
harmlessness of a petticoat, and&ndash;&ndash;as he had observed
from a dense blackberry thicket on the other side of
the fence, while she was at work hoeing her potatoes&ndash;&ndash;there
was an air about Mrs. Gammit which seemed
to give her petticoats the lie. He had watched
her for some time before he could quite satisfy
himself that she was a mere woman. Then he
had tried some nocturnal experiments on the
garden, sampling the young squashes which were
Mrs. Gammit&#8217;s peculiar pride, and finding them
so good that he had thought surely something would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
happen. Nothing did happen, however, because Mrs.
Gammit slept heavily; and her indignation in the
morning he had not been privileged to view.</p>
<p>After this he had grown bolder&ndash;&ndash;though always
under cover of night. He had sampled everything
in the garden&ndash;&ndash;the abundance of his foot-prints
convincing Mrs. Gammit that there was also an
abundance of bears. From the garden, at length,
he had ventured to the yard and the barn. In a
half-barrel, in a corner of the shed, he had stumbled
upon the ill-fated white top-knot hen, faithfully
brooding her eggs. Undeterred by her heroic scolding,
and by the trifling annoyance of her feathers
sticking in his teeth, he had made a very pleasant
meal of her. And still he had heard nothing from
Mrs. Gammit, who, for all her indignation, could not
depart from her custom of sound sleeping. If he
had taken the trouble to return in the morning, he
might have perceived that the good lady was far
from pleased, and that there was likely to be something
doing before long if he continued to take such
liberties with her. And then, as we have seen, he
had found the duck&ndash;&ndash;but <i>her</i> loss Mrs. Gammit had
taken calmly enough, declaring it to be nothing
more than a good riddance to bad rubbish.</p>
<p>It was not until the return of moonlight nights
that the bear had discovered the white pig, and thus
come face to face, at last, with a thoroughly aroused
Mrs. Gammit. True to his kind, he did like pork;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
but absorbed in the easier adventures of the garden
and the shed, he had not at first noted the rich
possibilities of the pig-pen, which occupied one
corner of the barn, under the loft. Suspicious of
traps, he would not, at first, enter the narrow
opening of the stable door, the wide main doors being
shut. He had preferred rather to sniff around outside
at the corner of the barn, under the ragged birch-tree
in which the big turkey-cock had his perch.
The wakeful and wary old bird, peering down upon
him with suspicion, had uttered a sharp <i>qwit, qwit</i>,
by way of warning to whom it might concern;
while the white pig, puzzled and worried, had sat up
in the dark interior of the pen and stared out at him
in silence through the cracks between the boards.
At last, growing impatient, the bear had caught the
edge of a board with his claws, and tried to tear it
off. Nothing had come except some big splinters;
but the effort, and the terrifying sound that accompanied
it, had proved too much for the self-control
of the white pig. An ear-splitting succession of
squeals had issued from the dark interior of the pen,
and the bear had backed off in amazement.</p>
<p>Before he could recover himself and renew his
assault, the window of the cabin had gone up with
a skittering slam. The white pig&#8217;s appeal for help
had penetrated Mrs. Gammit&#8217;s solid slumbers,
and she had understood the situation. &#8220;Scat!
you brute!&#8221; she had yelled frantically, thrusting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
head and shoulders so far out through the window
that she almost lost her balance in the effort to shake
both fists at once.</p>
<p>The bear, not understanding the terms of her
invective, had sat up on his haunches and turned
his one eye mildly upon the bristling tufts of grey
hair which formed a sort of halo around Mrs.
Gammit&#8217;s virginal nightcap. Then Mrs. Gammit,
realizing that the time for action was come, had
rushed downstairs to the kitchen, seized the first
weapon she could lay hands upon&ndash;&ndash;which chanced
to be the broom&ndash;&ndash;flung open the kitchen door, and
dashed across the yard, screaming with indignation.</p>
<p>It was certainly an unusual figure that she made in
the radiant moonlight, her sturdy, naked legs revolving
energetically beneath her sparse nightgown,
and the broom whirling vehemently around her head.
For a moment the bear had contemplated her with
wonder. Then his nerves had failed him. Doubtless,
this was a woman&ndash;&ndash;but not quite like the ordinary
kind. It was better, perhaps, to be careful. With
a reluctant grunt he had turned and fled, indifferent
to his dignity. And he had thought best not to stop
until he found himself quite beyond the range of
Mrs. Gammit&#8217;s disconcerting accents, which rang harsh
triumph across the solemn, silvered stillness of the
forest.</p>
<p>It was, of course, this imminent peril to the pig
which had roused Mrs. Gammit to action and sent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
her on that long tramp over the ridges to borrow
Joe Barron&#8217;s gun. In spite of her easy victory in
this particular instance, she had appreciated the
inches of that bear, and realized that in case of any
further unpleasantnesses with him a broom might
not prove to be the most efficient of weapons. With
the gun, however, and her distinct remembrance of
Joe Barron&#8217;s directions for its use, she felt equal to
the routing of any number of bears&ndash;&ndash;provided, of
course, they would not all come on together. As
the idea flashed across her mind that there might be a
pack of bears to face, she felt uneasy for a second,
and even thought of bringing the pig into the house
for the night, and conducting her campaign from
the bedroom window. Then she remembered she
had never heard of bears hunting in packs, and her
little apprehension vanished. In fact, she now grew
quite eager for night to bring the fray.</p>
<p>It was a favourite saw of Mrs. Gammit&#8217;s that &#8220;a
watched pot takes long to bile&#8221;; and her experience
that night exemplified it. With the kitchen
door ajar, she sat a little back from the window.
Herself hidden, she had a clear view across the bright
yard. Very slowly the round moon climbed the
pallid summer sky, changing the patterns of the
shadows as she rose. But the bear came not. Mrs.
Gammit began to think, even to fear, that her impetuosity
of the night before had frightened him away.
At last her reveries grew confused. She sat up very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
straight, and blinked very hard, to make sure that
she was quite awake. Just as she had got herself
most perfectly reassured on this point, her head sank
gently forward upon the window-sill, and she slept
deeply, with her cheek against the cold, brown barrel
of the gun.</p>
<p>Yes, the bear had hesitated long that night.
And he came late. The moon had swung past her
zenith, and was pointing her black shadows across
the yard in quite another direction when he came.
By this time he had recovered confidence and made
up his mind that Mrs. Gammit <i>was</i> only a woman.
After sniffing once more at the cracks to assure himself
that the pig was still there, he went around to the
stable door and crept cautiously in.</p>
<p>As his clumsy black shape appeared in the bright
opening, the pig saw it. It filled his heart with a
quite justifiable horror, which found instant poignant
expression. Within those four walls the noise
was so startlingly loud that, in spite of himself, the
bear drew back&ndash;&ndash;not intending to retreat, indeed,
but only to consider. As it chanced, however,
seeing out of only one eye, he backed upon the
handle of a hay rake which was leaning against the
wall. The rake very properly resented this. It fell
upon him and clutched at his fur like a live thing.
Startled quite out of his self-possession, he retreated
hurriedly into the moonlight, for further consideration
of these unexpected phenomena. And as he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
did so, across the yard the kitchen door was flung
open, and Mrs. Gammit, with the gun, rushed forth.</p>
<p>The bear had intended to retire behind the barn
for a few moments, the better to weigh the situation.
But at the sight of Mrs. Gammit&#8217;s fluttering petticoat
he began to feel annoyed. It seemed to him
that he was being thwarted unnecessarily. At the
corner of the barn, just under the jutting limb of
the birch-tree, he stopped, turned, and sat up on his
haunches with a growl. The old turkey-cock,
stretching his lean neck, glared down upon him with
a terse <i>qwit! qwit!</i> of disapproval.</p>
<p>When the bear stopped, in that resolute and
threatening attitude, Mrs. Gammit instinctively
stopped too. Not, as she would have explained
had there been any one to explain to, that she was
&#8220;one mite scairt,&#8221; but that she wanted to try Joe
Barren&#8217;s gun. Raising the gun to her shoulder,
she shut one eye, looked carefully at the point of
the barrel with the other, and pulled the trigger.
Nothing whatever happened. Lowering the weapon
from her shoulder she eyed it severely, and perceived
that she had forgotten to cock it. At this a shade
of embarrassment passed over her face, and she glanced
sharply at the bear to see if he had noticed her mistake.
Apparently, he had not. He was still sitting
there, regarding her unpleasantly with his one small
eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye needn&#8217;t think ye&#8217;re agoin to git off, jest because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
I made a leetle mistake like that!&#8221; muttered
Mrs. Gammit, shutting her teeth with a snap, and
cocking the gun as she raised it once more to her
shoulder.</p>
<p>Now, as it chanced, Joe Barren had neglected to
tell her which eye to shut, so, not unnaturally, Mrs.
Gammit shut the one nearest to the gun&ndash;&ndash;nearest
to the cap which was about to go off. She also neglected
to consider the hind-sight. It was enough
for her that the muzzle of the gun seemed to cover
the bear. Under these conditions she got a very
good line on her target, but her elevation was somewhat
at fault. She pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>This time it was all right. There was a terrific,
roaring explosion, and she staggered backwards
under the savage kick of the recoil. Recovering
herself instantly, and proud of the great noise she
had made, she peered through the smoke, expecting
to see the bear topple over upon his nose, extinguished.
Instead of that, however, she observed a
convulsive flopping of wings in the birch-tree above
the bear&#8217;s head. Then, with one reproachful
&#8220;gobble&#8221; which rang loud in Mrs. Gammit&#8217;s ears,
the old turkey-cock fell heavily to the ground. He
would have fallen straight upon the bear, but that
the latter, his nerves completely upset by so much
disturbance, was making off at fine speed through
the bushes.</p>
<p>The elation on Mrs. Gammit&#8217;s face gave way to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
consternation. Then she reddened to the ears with
wrath, dashed the offending gun to the ground, and
stamped on it. She had done her part, that she knew,
but the wretched weapon had played her false. Well,
she had never thought much of guns, anyway. Henceforth
she would depend on herself.</p>
<p>The unfortunate turkey-cock now lay quite still.
Mrs. Gammit crossed the yard and bent over the
sprawling body in deep regret. She had had a
certain affection for the noisy and self-sufficient
old bird, who had been &#8220;company&#8221; for her as he
strutted &#8220;gobbling&#8221; about the yard with stiff-trailed
wings while his hens were away brooding
their chicks. &#8220;Too bad!&#8221; she muttered over him,
by way of requiem; &#8220;too bad ye had to go an&#8217; git in
the road o&#8217; that blame gun!&#8221; Then, suddenly bethinking
herself that a fowl was more easily plucked
while yet warm, she carried the limp corpse, head
downward, across the yard, fetched a basket from
the kitchen, sat down on the doorstep in the moonlight,
and began sadly stripping the victim of his
feathers. He was a fine, heavy bird. As she surveyed
his ample proportions Mrs. Gammit murmured
thoughtfully: &#8220;I reckon as how I&#8217;m goin&#8217;
to feel kinder sick o&#8217; turkey afore I git this all
et up!&#8221;</p>
<p>On the following day Mrs. Gammit carefully
polished the gun with a duster, removing all trace
of the indignities she had put upon it, and stood it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
away behind the dresser. She had resolved to
conduct the rest of the campaign against the bears
in her own way and with her own weapons. The
way and the weapons she now proceeded to think out
with utmost care.</p>
<p>Being a true woman and a true housewife, it was
perhaps inevitable that she should think first, and,
after due consideration given to everything else,
including pitchforks and cayenne pepper, that she
should think last and finally, of the unlimited
potentialities of boiling water. To have it actually
boiling, at the critical moment, would of course be
impracticable; but with a grim smile she concluded
that she could manage to have it hot enough for her
purpose. She had observed that this bear which
was after the pig had learned the way into the pen.
She felt sure that, having found from experience
that loud noises did not produce bodily injuries, he
would again come seeking the pig, and this time with
more confidence than ever.</p>
<p>On this point, thanks to her ignorance of bears in
general, she was right. Most bears would have
been discouraged. But this bear in particular had
learned that when men started out to be disagreeable
to bears, they succeeded only too well. He had
realized clearly that Mrs. Gammit had intended to
be disagreeable to him. There was no mistaking
her intentions. But she had not succeeded. Ergo,
she was not, as he had almost feared, a man, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
really and truly a woman. He came back the next
night fully determined that no squeals, or brooms,
or flying petticoats, or explosions, should divert
him from his purpose and his pork. He came early;
but not, as it chanced, too early for Mrs. Gammit,
who seemed somehow to have divined his plans and
so taken time by the forelock.</p>
<p>The pen of the white pig, as we have already
noted, was in a corner of the barn, and under one
end of the loft. Immediately above the point where
the bear would have to climb over, in order to get
into the pen, Mrs. Gammit removed several of the
loose boards which formed the flooring of the loft.
Beside this opening, at an early hour, she had ensconced
herself in secure ambuscade, with three
pails of the hottest possible hot water close beside
her. The pails were well swathed in blankets,
quilts, and hay, to keep up the temperature of their
contents. And she had also a pitchfork &#8220;layin&#8217;
handy,&#8221; wherewith to push the enemy down in
case he should resent her attack and climb up to
expostulate.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gammit had not time to grow sleepy, or
even impatient, so early did the bear arrive. The
white pig, disturbed and puzzled by the unwonted
goings-on above his head, had refused to go to bed.
He was wandering restlessly up and down the pen,
when, through the cracks, he saw an awful black
shadow darken the stable door. He lost not a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
second, but lifted his voice at once in one of those
ear-piercing appeals which had now twice proved
themselves so effective.</p>
<p>The bear paused but for a moment, to cast his
solitary eye over the situation. Mrs. Gammit fairly
held her breath. Then, almost before she could
realize what he was doing, he was straight beneath
her, and clambering into the pen. The white pig&#8217;s
squeals redoubled, electrifying her to action. She
snatched a steaming bucket from its wrappings,
and dashed it down upon the vaguely heaving form
below.</p>
<p>On the instant there arose a strange, confused,
terrific uproar, from which the squeals of the white
pig stood out thin and pathetic. Without waiting
to see what she had accomplished, Mrs. Gammit
snatched up the second bucket, and leaned forward
to deliver a second stroke. Through a cloud of
steam she saw the bear reaching wildly for the wall
of the pen, clawing frantically in his eagerness to
climb over and get away. She had given him a
lesson, that was clear; but she was resolved to give
him a good one while she was about it. Swinging
far forward, she launched her terrible missile
straight upon his huge hind-quarters just as they
went over the wall. But at the same moment she
lost her balance. With an indignant yell she plunged
downward into the pen.</p>
<p>It was like Mrs. Gammit, however, that even in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
this dark moment her luck should serve her. She
landed squarely on the back of the pig. This
broke her fall, and, strangely enough, did not break
the pig. The latter, quite frenzied by the accumulation
of horrors heaped upon him, bounced frantically
from beneath her indiscreet petticoats, and
dashed himself from one side of the pen to the other
with a violence that threatened to wreck both pig
and pen.</p>
<p>Somewhat breathless, but proudly conscious that
she had won a splendid victory, Mrs. Gammit
picked herself up and shook herself together. The
bear had vanished. She eyed with amazement the
continued gyrations of the pig.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor dear!&#8221; she muttered presently, &#8220;some o&#8217;
the bilin&#8217; water must &#8217;ave slopped on to him! Oh,
well, I reckon he&#8217;ll git over it bime-by. Anyhow,
it&#8217;s a sight better&#8217;n being all clawed an&#8217; et up by a
bear, I reckon!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gammit now felt satisfied that this particular
bear would trouble her no more, and she had
high hopes that his experience with hot water
would serve as a lesson to all the other bears with
whom she imagined herself involved. The sequel
fulfilled her utmost expectations. The bear, smarting
from his scalds and with all his preconceived
ideas about women overthrown, betook himself in
haste to another and remoter hunting-ground. A
good deal of his hair came off, in patches, and for a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
long time he had a rather poor opinion of himself.</p>
<p>When, for over a week, there had been no more
raids upon barn or chicken-roost, and no more
bear-tracks about the garden, Mrs. Gammit knew
that her victory had been final, and she felt so elated
that she was even able to enjoy her continuing diet of
cold turkey. Then, one pleasant morning when a
fresh, sweet-smelling wind made tumult in the forest,
she took the gun home to Joe Barren.</p>
<p>&#8220;What luck did ye hev, Mrs. Gammit?&#8221; inquired
the woodsman with interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I settled them bears, Mr. Barren!&#8221; she replied.
&#8220;But it wasn&#8217;t the gun as done it. It was bilin&#8217;
water. I&#8217;ve found ye kin always depend on bilin&#8217;
water!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope the gun acted right by you, however!&#8221;
said the woodsman.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gammit&#8217;s voice took on a tone of reserve.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Barren, I thank ye kindly for the
loan of the weepon. Ye <i>meant</i> right. But it&#8217;s on
my mind to warn ye. Don&#8217;t ye go for to trust
that gun, or ye&#8217;ll live to regret it. <i>It don&#8217;t hit what
it&#8217;s aimed at.</i>&#8221;</p>

<h2><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>The Blackwater Pot</span></h2>
</div>
<p>The lesson of fear was one which Henderson
learned late. He learned it well, however,
when the time came. And it was Blackwater Pot
that taught him.</p>
<p>Sluggishly, reluctantly, impotently, the spruce
logs followed one another round and round the circuit
of the great stone pot. The circling water
within the pot was smooth and deep and black,
but streaked with foam. At one side a gash in the
rocky rim opened upon the sluicing current of the
river, which rushed on, quivering and seething, to
plunge with a roar into the terrific cauldron of the
falls. Out of that thunderous cauldron, filled with
huge tramplings and the shriek of tortured torrents,
rose a white curtain of spray, which every now and
then swayed upward and drenched the green birches
which grew about the rim of the pot. For the break
in the rim, which caught at the passing current and
sucked it into the slow swirls of Blackwater Pot,
was not a dozen feet from the lip of the falls.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></p>
<p>Henderson sat at the foot of a ragged white birch
which leaned from the upper rim of the pot. He
held his pipe unlighted, while he watched the logs
with a half-fascinated stare. Outside, in the river, he
saw them in a clumsy panic haste, wallowing down
the white rapids to their awful plunge. When a
log came close along shore its fate hung for a
second or two in doubt. It might shoot straight on,
over the lip, into the wavering curtain of spray and
vanish into the horror of the cauldron. Or, at the
last moment, the eddy might reach out stealthily
and drag it into the sullen wheeling procession within
the pot. All that it gained here, however, was a
terrible kind of respite, a breathing-space of agonized
suspense. As it circled around, and came again to
the opening by which it had entered, it might continue
on another eventless revolution, or it might,
according to the whim of the eddy, be cast forth
once more, irretrievably, into the clutch of the awful
sluice. Sometimes two logs, after a pause in what
seemed like a secret death-struggle, would crowd
each other out and go over the falls together. And
sometimes, on the other hand, all would make the
circuit safely again and again. But always, at the
cleft in the rim of the pot, there was the moment of
suspense, the shuddering, terrible panic.</p>
<p>It was this recurring moment that seemed to fasten
itself balefully upon Henderson&#8217;s imagination,
so that he forgot to smoke. He had looked into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
the Blackwater before, but never when there were
any logs in the pot. Moreover, on this particular
morning, he was overwrought with weariness. For
a little short of three days he had been at the utmost
tension of body, brain, and nerve, in hot but wary
pursuit of a desperado whom it was his duty, as
deputy-sheriff of his county, to capture and bring
to justice.</p>
<p>This outlaw, a French half-breed, known through
the length and breadth of the wild backwoods
county as &#8220;Red Pichot,&#8221; was the last but one&ndash;&ndash;and
accounted the most dangerous&ndash;&ndash;of a band which
Henderson had undertaken to break up. Henderson
had been deputy for two years, and owed his
appointment primarily to his pre-eminent fitness
for this very task. Unacquainted with fear, he was
at the same time unrivalled through the backwoods
counties for his subtle woodcraft, his sleepless endurance,
and his cunning.</p>
<p>It was two years now since he had set his hand
to the business. One of the gang had been hanged.
Two were in the penitentiary, on life sentence. Henderson
had justified his appointment to every one
except himself. But while Pichot and his gross-witted
tool, &#8220;Bug&#8221; Mitchell, went unhanged,
he felt himself on probation, if not shamed. Mitchell
he despised. But Pichot, the brains of the gang,
he honoured with a personal hatred that held
a streak of rivalry. For Pichot, though a beast
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
for cruelty and treachery, and with the murder of a
woman on his black record&ndash;&ndash;which placed him,
according to Henderson&#8217;s ideas, in a different
category from a mere killer of men&ndash;&ndash;was at the same
time a born leader and of a courage none could
question. Some chance dash of Scotch Highland
blood in his mixed veins had set a mop of hot red
hair above his black, implacable eyes and cruel, dark
face. It had touched his villainies, too, with an
imagination which made them the more atrocious.
And Henderson&#8217;s hate for him as a man was mixed
with respect for the adversary worthy of his
powers.</p>
<p>Reaching the falls, Henderson had been forced to
acknowledge that, once again, Pichot had outwitted
him on the trail. Satisfied that his quarry was by
this time far out of reach among the tangled ravines
on the other side of Two Mountains, he dismissed
the two tired river-men who constituted his posse,
bidding them go on down the river to Greensville
and wait for him. It was his plan to hunt alone for
a couple of days in the hope of catching his adversary
off guard. He had an ally, unsuspected and
invaluable, in a long-legged, half-wild youngster
of a girl, who lived alone with her father in a clearing
about a mile below the falls, and regarded Henderson
with a childlike hero-worship. This shy little
savage, whom all the Settlement knew as &#8220;Baisley&#8217;s
Sis,&#8221; had an intuitive knowledge of the wilderness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
and the trails which rivalled even Henderson&#8217;s accomplished
woodcraft; and the indomitable deputy
&#8220;set great store,&#8221; as he would have put it, by her
friendship. He would go down presently to the
clearing and ask some questions of the child. But
first he wanted to do a bit of thinking. To think the
better, the better to collect his tired and scattered
wits, he had stood his Winchester carefully upright
between two spruce saplings, filled his pipe, lighted
it with relish, and seated himself under the old birch
where he could look straight down upon the wheeling
logs in Blackwater Pot.</p>
<p>It was while he was looking down into the terrible
eddy that his efforts to think failed him and his
pipe went out, and his interest in the fortunes
of the captive logs gradually took the hold of
a nightmare upon his overwrought imagination.
One after one he would mark, snatched in by the
capricious eddy and held back a little while from
its doom. One after one he would see crowded out
again, by inexplicable whim, and hurled on into the
raging horror of the falls. He fell to personifying
this captive log or that, endowing it with sentience,
and imagining its emotions each time it circled
shuddering past the cleft in the rim, once more
precariously reprieved.</p>
<p>At last, either because he was more deeply exhausted
than he knew, or because he had fairly
dropped asleep with his eyes open and his fantastic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
imaginings had slipped into a veritable dream, he felt
himself suddenly become identified with one of the
logs. It was one which was just drawing around to
the fateful cleft. Would it win past once more?
No; it was too far out! It felt the grasp of the
outward suction, soft and insidious at first, then resistless
as the falling of a mountain. With straining
nerves and pounding heart Henderson strove to hold
it back by sheer will and the wrestling of his
eyes. But it was no use. Slowly the head of the
log turned outward from its circling fellows, quivered
for a moment in the cleft, then shot smoothly forth
into the sluice. With a groan Henderson came to
his senses, starting up and catching instinctively
at the butt of the heavy Colt in his belt. At the same
instant the coil of a rope settled over his shoulders,
pinioning his arms to his sides, and he was jerked
backwards with a violence that fairly lifted him
over the projecting root of the birch. As he fell
his head struck a stump; and he knew nothing
more.</p>
<p>When Henderson came to his senses he found
himself in a most bewildering position. He was
lying face downwards along a log, his mouth
pressed upon the rough bark. His arms and legs
were in the water, on either side of the log. Other
logs moved past him sluggishly. For a moment he
thought himself still in the grip of his nightmare, and
he struggled to wake himself. The struggle revealed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
to him that he was bound fast upon the log. At
this his wits cleared up, with a pang that was more
near despair than anything he had ever known.
Then his nerve steadied itself back into its wonted
control.</p>
<p>He realized what had befallen him. His enemies
had back-trailed him and caught him off his guard.
He was just where, in his awful dream, he had
imagined himself as being. He was bound to one of
the logs down in the great stone pot of Blackwater
Eddy.</p>
<p>For a second or two the blood in his veins
ran ice, as he braced himself to feel the log
lurch out into the sluice and plunge into the
trampling of the abyss. Then he observed that the
other logs were overtaking and passing him. His
log, indeed, was not moving at all. Evidently,
then, it was being held by some one. He tried to
look around, but found himself so fettered that he
could only lift his face a few inches from the log.
This enabled him to see the whole surface of the eddy
and the fateful cleft, and out across the raving
torrents into the white curtain that swayed above
the cauldron. But he could not, with the utmost
twisting and stretching of his neck, see more than a
couple of feet up the smooth stone sides of the
pot.</p>
<p>As he strained on his bonds he heard a harsh
chuckle behind him; and the log, suddenly loosed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
with a jerk which showed him it had been held by
a pike-pole, began to move. A moment later the
sharp, steel-armed end of the pike-pole came down
smartly on the forward end of the log, within a dozen
inches of Henderson&#8217;s head, biting a secure hold.
The log again came to a stop. Slowly, under pressure
from the other end of the pike-pole, it rolled
outward, submerging Henderson&#8217;s right shoulder,
and turning his face till he could see all the way up
the sides of the pot.</p>
<p>What he saw, on a ledge about three feet above
the water, was Red Pichot, holding the pike-pole
and smiling down upon him smoothly. On the rim
above squatted Bug Mitchell, scowling, and gripping
his knife as if he thirsted to settle up all scores on
the instant. Imagination was lacking in Mitchell&#8217;s
make-up; and he was impatient&ndash;&ndash;so far as he dared
to be&ndash;&ndash;of Pichot&#8217;s fantastic procrastinatings.</p>
<p>When Henderson&#8217;s eyes met the evil, smiling
glance of his enemy they were steady and cold as
steel. To Henderson, who had always, in every
situation, felt himself master, there remained now
no mastery but that of his own will, his own spirit.
In his estimation there could be no death so dreadful
but that to let his spirit cower before his adversary
would be tenfold worse. Helpless though he was,
in a position that was ignominiously and grotesquely
horrible, and with the imminence of an appalling
doom close before his eyes, his nerve never failed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
him. With cool contempt and defiance he met Red
Pichot&#8217;s smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always had an idee,&#8221; said the half-breed,
presently, in a smooth voice that penetrated the mighty
vibrations of the falls, &#8220;ez how a chap on a log
could paddle roun&#8217; this yere eddy fer a deuce of
a while afore he&#8217;d hev to git sucked out into the
sluice!&#8221;</p>
<p>As a theory this was undoubtedly interesting. But
Henderson made no answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve held that idee,&#8221; continued Pichot, after a
civil pause, &#8220;though I hain&#8217;t never yet found a
man, nor a woman nuther, as was willin&#8217; to give it
a fair trial. But I feel sure ye&#8217;re the man to
oblige me. I&#8217;ve left yer arms kinder free, leastways
from the elbows down, an&#8217; yer legs also, more or
less, so&#8217;s ye&#8217;ll be able to paddle easy-like. The
walls of the pot&#8217;s all worn so smooth, below high-water
mark, there&#8217;s nothin&#8217; to ketch on to, so there&#8217;ll

ye&#8217;ll give the matter a right fair trial. But ef ye
gits tired an&#8217; feels like givin&#8217; up, why, don&#8217;t consider
my feelin&#8217;s. There&#8217;s the falls awaitin&#8217;. An&#8217;
I ain&#8217;t agoin&#8217; to bear no grudge ef ye don&#8217;t quite come
up to my expectations of ye.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Pichot ceased his measured harangue he
jerked his pike-pole loose. Instantly the log began
to forge forward, joining the reluctant procession.
For a few moments Henderson felt like shutting his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
eyes and his teeth and letting himself go on with all
speed to the inevitable doom. Then, with scorn
of the weak impulse, he changed his mind. To the
last gasp he would maintain his hold on life, and
give fortune a chance to save him. When he could
no longer resist, then it would be Fate&#8217;s responsibility,
not his. The better to fight the awful fight that
was before him, he put clear out of his mind the
picture of Red Pichot and Mitchell perched on the
brink above, smoking, and grinning down upon the
writhings of their victim. In a moment, as his log
drew near the cleft, he had forgotten them. There
was room now in all his faculties for but one impulse,
one consideration.</p>
<p>The log to which he was bound was on the extreme
outer edge of the procession, and Henderson realized
that there was every probability of its being at once
crowded out the moment it came to the exit. With
a desperate effort he succeeded in catching the log
nearest to him, pushing it ahead, and at last, just
as they came opposite the cleft, steering his own
log into its place. The next second it shot quivering
forth into the sluice, and Henderson, with a sudden
cold sweat jumping out all over him, circled slowly
past the awful cleft. A shout of ironical congratulation
came to him from the watchers on
the brink above. But he hardly heard it, and
heeded it not at all. He was striving frantically,
paddling forward with one hand and backward with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
the other, to steer his sluggish, deep-floating log
from the outer to the inner circle. He had already
observed that to be on the outer edge would mean
instant doom for him, because the outward suction
was stronger underneath than on the surface, and his
weighted log caught its force before the others did.
His arms were so bound that only from the elbows
down could he move them freely. He did, however,
by a struggle which left him gasping, succeed in working
in behind another log&ndash;&ndash;just in time to see
that log, too, sucked out into the abyss, and himself
once more on the deadly outer flank of the circling
procession.</p>
<p>This time Henderson did not know whether the
watchers on the brink laughed or not as he won past
the cleft. He was scheming desperately to devise
some less exhausting tactics. Steadily and rhythmically,
but with his utmost force, he back-paddled
with both hands and feet, till the progress of his log
was almost stopped. Then he succeeded in catching
yet another log as it passed and man&oelig;uvring
in behind it. By this time he was halfway around
the pot again. Yet again, by his desperate back-paddling,
he checked his progress, and presently,
by most cunning manipulation, managed to edge in
behind yet another log, so that when he again came
round to the cleft there were two logs between him
and doom. The outermost of these, however, was
dragged instantly forth into the fury of the sluice,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
thrust forward, as it was, by the grip of the suction
upon Henderson&#8217;s own deep log. Feeling himself
on the point of utter exhaustion, he nevertheless continued
back-paddling, and steering and working
inward, till he had succeeded in getting three files
of logs between himself and the outer edge. Then,
almost blind and with the blood roaring so loud in
his ears that he could hardly hear the trampling of
the falls, he hung on his log, praying that strength
might flow back speedily into his veins and
nerves.</p>
<p>Not till he had twice more made the circuit of the
pot, and twice more seen a log sucked out from
his very elbow to leap into the white horror of the
abyss, did Henderson stir. The brief stillness,
controlled by his will, had rested him for the moment.
He was cool now, keen to plan, cunning to husband
his forces. Up to the very last second that he could
he would maintain his hold on life, counting always
on the chance of the unexpected.</p>
<p>With now just one log remaining between himself
and death, he let himself go past the cleft, and
saw that one log go out. Then, being close to the
wall of the pot, he tried to delay his progress by clutching
at the stone with his left hand and by dragging
upon it with his foot. But the stone surface
was worn so smooth by the age-long polishing
of the eddy that these efforts availed him little.
Before he realized it he was almost round again,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
and only by the most desperate struggle did he
succeed in saving himself. There was no other log
near by this time for him to seize and thrust forward
in his place. It was simply a question of his restricted
paddling, with hands and feet, against the
outward draught of the current. For nearly a
minute the log hung in doubt just before the opening,
the current sucking at its head to turn it outward,
and Henderson paddling against it not only with
hands and feet, but with every ounce of will and
nerve that his body contained. At last, inch by
inch, he conquered. His log moved past the gate
of death; and dimly, again, that ironical voice
came down to him, piercing the roar.</p>
<p>Once past, Henderson fell to back-paddling again&ndash;&ndash;not
so violently now&ndash;&ndash;till other logs came by within
his reach and he could work himself into temporary
safety behind them. He was soon forced to the
conviction that if he strove at just a shade under
his utmost he was able to hold his own and keep one
log always between himself and the opening. But
what was now his utmost, he realized, would very
soon be far beyond his powers. Well, there was
nothing to do but to keep on trying. Around and
around, and again and again around the terrible,
smooth, deliberate circuit he went, sparing himself
every ounce of effort that he could, and always
shutting his eyes as the log beside him plunged
out into the sluice. Gradually, then, he felt himself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
becoming stupefied by the ceaselessly recurring
horror, with the prolonged suspense between. He
must sting himself back to the full possession of his
faculties by another burst of fierce effort. Fiercely
he caught at log after log, without a let-up, till, luck
having favoured him for once, he found himself on
the inner instead of the outer edge of the procession.
Then an idea flashed into his fast-clouding brain,
and he cursed himself for not having thought of it
before. At the very centre of the eddy, of course,
there must be a sort of core of stillness. By a
vehement struggle he attained it and avoided crossing
it. Working gently and warily he kept the log right
across the axis of the eddy, where huddled a crowd
of chips and sticks. Here the log turned slowly,
very slowly, on its own centre; and for a few
seconds of exquisite relief Henderson let himself
sink into a sort of lethargy. He was roused by a
sudden shot, and the spat of a heavy bullet into the
log about three inches before his head. Even
through the shaking thunder of the cataract he
thought he recognized the voice of his own heavy
Colt; and the idea of that tried weapon being
turned against himself filled him with childish rage.
Without lifting his head he lay and cursed, grinding
his teeth impotently. A few seconds later came
another shot, and this time the ball went into the
log just before his right arm. Then he understood,
and woke up. Pichot was a dead shot. This was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
his intimation that Henderson must get out into the
procession again. At the centre of the eddy he was
not sufficiently entertaining to his executioners.
The idea of being shot in the head had not greatly
disturbed him&ndash;&ndash;he had felt as if it would be rather
restful, on the whole. But the thought of getting
a bullet in his arm, which would merely disable
him and deliver him over helpless to the outdraught,
shook him with something near a panic. He fell to
paddling with all his remaining strength, and drove
his log once more into the horrible circuit. The
commendatory remarks with which Pichot greeted
this move went past his ears unheard.</p>
<p>Up to this time there had been a strong sun
shining down into the pot, and the trees about its
rim had stood unstirred by any wind. Now, however,
a sudden darkness settled over everything,
and sharp, fitful gusts drew in through the cleft,
helping to push the logs back. Henderson was
by this time so near fainting from exhaustion that
his wits were losing their clearness. Only his horror
of the fatal exit, the raving sluice, the swaying white
spray-curtain, retained its keenness. As to all else
he was growing so confused that he hardly realized
the way those great indrawing gusts, laden with
spray, were helping him. He was paddling and
steering and man&oelig;uvring for the inner circuit
almost mechanically now. When suddenly the
blackness about him was lit with a blue glare, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
the thunder crashed over the echoing pot with an
explosion that outroared the falls, he hardly noted it.
When the skies seemed to open, letting down the
rain in torrents, with a wind that almost blew it
level, it made no difference to him. He went on
paddling dully, indifferent to the bumping of the
logs against his shoulders.</p>

&#8220;<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>He was roused by a sudden shot.</span>&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>But to this fierce storm, which almost bent double
the trees around the rim of the pot, Red Pichot and
Mitchell were by no means so indifferent. About
sixty or seventy yards below the falls they had a snug
retreat which was also an outlook. It was a cabin
built in a recess of the wall of the gorge, and to be
reached only by a narrow pathway easy of defence.
When the storm broke in its fury Pichot sprang to
his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s git back to the Hole,&#8221; he cried to his
companion, knocking the fire out of his pipe. &#8220;We
kin watch just as well from there, an&#8217; see the beauty
slide over when his time comes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pichot led the way off through the straining and
hissing trees, and Mitchell followed, growling but
obedient. And Henderson, faint upon his log in
the raving tumult, knew nothing of their going.</p>
<p>They had not been gone more than two minutes
when a drenched little dark face, with black hair
plastered over it in wisps, peered out from among
the lashing birches and gazed down anxiously into
the pot. At the sight of Henderson on his log,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
lying quite close to the edge, and far back from the
dreadful cleft, the terror in the wild eyes gave way
to inexpressible relief. The face drew back; and
an instant later a bare-legged child appeared, carrying
the pike-pole which Pichot had tossed into the
bushes. Heedless of the sheeting volleys of the
rain and the fierce gusts which whipped her dripping
homespun petticoat about her knees, she clambered
skilfully down the rock wall to the ledge whereon
Pichot had stood. Bracing herself carefully, she
reached out with the pike-pole, which, child though
she was, she evidently knew how to use.</p>
<p>Henderson was just beginning to recover from
his daze, and to notice the madness of the storm,
when he felt something strike sharply on the log
behind him. He knew it was the impact of a pike
pole, and he wondered, with a kind of scornful
disgust, what Pichot could be wanting of him now.
He felt the log being dragged backwards, then held
close against the smooth wall of the pot. A moment
more and his bonds were being cut&ndash;&ndash;but laboriously,
as if with a small knife and by weak hands. Then
he caught sight of the hands, which were little
and brown and rough, and realized, with a great
burst of wonder and tenderness, that old Baisley&#8217;s
&#8220;Sis,&#8221; by some miracle of miracles, had come to
his rescue. In a few seconds the ropes fell apart,
and he lifted himself, to see the child stooping down
with anxious adoration in her eyes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sis!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;You!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Henderson, come quick!&#8221; she panted.
&#8220;They may git back any minit.&#8221; And clutching
him by the shoulder, she tried to pull him up
by main strength. But Henderson needed no
urging. Life, with the return of hope, had surged
back into nerve and muscle; and in hardly more
time than it takes to tell it, the two had clambered
side by side to the rim of the pot and darted into
the covert of the tossing trees.</p>
<p>No sooner were they in hiding than Henderson
remembered his rifle and slipped back to get it
His enemies had not discovered it. It had fallen
into the moss, but the well-oiled, perfect-fitting
chamber had kept its cartridges dry. With that
weapon in his hands Henderson felt himself once
more master of the situation. Weariness and
apprehension together slipped from him, and one
purpose took complete possession of him. He
would settle with Red Pichot right there, on the
spot where he had been taught the terrible lesson of
fear. He felt that he could not really feel himself
a man again unless he could settle the whole score
before the sun of that day should set.</p>
<p>The rain and wind were diminishing now; the
lightning was a mere shuddering gleam over the
hill-tops beyond the river; and the thunder no
longer made itself heard above the trampling of the
falls. Henderson&#8217;s plans were soon laid. Then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
he turned to Sis, who stood silent and motionless
close at his side, her big, alert, shy eyes watching
like a hunted deer&#8217;s the trail by which Red Pichot
might return. She was trembling in her heart at
every moment that Henderson lingered within that
zone of peril. But she would not presume to suggest
any move.</p>
<p>Suddenly Henderson turned to her and laid an
arm about her little shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;You saved my life, kid!&#8221; he said, softly.
&#8220;How ever did you know I was down there in that
hell?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I jest <i>knowed</i> it was you, when I seen Red Pichot
an&#8217; Bug Mitchell a-trackin&#8217; some one,&#8221; answered
the child, still keeping her eyes on the trail, as if it
was her part to see that Henderson was not again
taken unawares. &#8220;I <i>knowed</i> it was you, Mister
Henderson, an&#8217; I followed &#8217;em; an&#8217; oh, I seen it all,
I seen it all, an&#8217; I most died because I hadn&#8217;t no
gun. But I&#8217;d &#8217;ave killed &#8217;em both, some day, sure,
ef&ndash;&ndash;ef they hadn&#8217;t went away! But they&#8217;ll be back
now right quick.&#8221;</p>
<p>Henderson bent and kissed her wet black head,
saying, &#8220;Bless you, kid! You an&#8217; me&#8217;ll always be
pals, I reckon!&#8221;</p>
<p>At the kiss the child&#8217;s face flushed, and, for one
second forgetting to watch the trail, she lifted glowing
eyes to his. But he was already looking
away.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;This ain&#8217;t no place
for you an&#8217; me <i>yet</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Making a careful circuit through the thick undergrowth,
swiftly but silently as two wildcats, the
strange pair gained a covert close beside the trail
by which Pichot and Mitchell would return to the
rim of the pot. Safely ambuscaded, Henderson laid
a hand firmly on the child&#8217;s arm, resting it there for
two or three seconds, as a sign of silence.</p>
<p>Minute after minute went by in the intense stillness.
At last the child, whose ears were even keener
than Henderson&#8217;s, caught her breath with a little
indrawing gasp and looked up at her companion&#8217;s
face. Henderson understood; and every muscle
stiffened. A moment later and he, too, heard the
oncoming tread of hurried footsteps. Then Pichot
went by at a swinging stride, with Mitchell skulking
obediently at his heels.</p>
<p>Henderson half raised his rifle, and his face turned
grey and cold like steel. But it was no part of his
plan to shoot even Red Pichot in the back. From
the manner of the two ruffians it was plain that they
had no suspicion of the turn which affairs had taken.
To them it was as sure as two and two make four
that Henderson was still on his log in the pot, if he
had not already gone over into the cauldron. As
they reached the rim Henderson stepped out into
the trail behind them, his gun balanced ready like
a trapshooter&#8217;s.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></p>
<p>As Pichot, on the very brink, looked down into the
pot and saw that his victim was no longer there, he
turned to Mitchell with a smile of mingled triumph
and disappointment.</p>
<p>But, on the instant, the smile froze on his face. It
was as if he had felt the cold, grey gaze of Henderson
on the back of his neck. Some warning, certainly,
was flashed to that mysterious sixth sense
which the people of the wild, man or beast, seem
sometimes to be endowed with. He wheeled like
lightning, his revolver seeming to leap up from his
belt with the same motion. But in the same
fraction of a second that his eyes met Henderson&#8217;s
they met the white flame-spurt of Henderson&#8217;s
rifle&ndash;&ndash;and then, the dark.</p>
<p>As Pichot&#8217;s body collapsed, it toppled over the
rim into Blackwater Pot and fell across two moving
logs. Mitchell had thrown up his hands straight
above his head when Pichot fell, knowing instantly
that that was his only hope of escaping the same
fate as his leader&#8217;s.</p>
<p>One look at Henderson&#8217;s face, however, satisfied
him that he was not going to be dealt with on the
spot, and he set his thick jaw stolidly. Then his
eyes wandered down into the pot, following the
leader whom, in his way, he had loved if ever he had
loved any one or anything. Fascinated, his stare
followed the two logs as they journeyed around,
with Pichot&#8217;s limp form, face upwards, sprawled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
across them. They reached the cleft, turned, and
shot forth into the raving of the sluice, and a groan
of horror burst from &#8220;Bug&#8217;s&#8221; lips. By this Henderson
knew what had happened, and, to his immeasurable
self-scorn, a qualm of remembered fear caught
sickeningly at his heart. But nothing of this
betrayed itself in his face or voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Mitchell!&#8221; he said, briskly. &#8220;I&#8217;m
in a hurry. You jest step along in front, an&#8217; see ye
keep both hands well up over yer head, or ye&#8217;ll be
savin&#8217; the county the cost o&#8217; yer rope. Step out,
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stood aside, with Sis at his elbow, to make
room. As Mitchell passed, his hands held high, a
mad light flamed up into his sullen eyes, and he
was on the point of springing, like a wolf, at his
captor&#8217;s throat. But Henderson&#8217;s look was cool
and steady, and his gun held low. The impulse
flickered out in the brute&#8217;s dull veins. But as he
glanced at Sis he suddenly understood that it was
she who had brought all this to pass. His black
face snarled upon her like a wolf&#8217;s at bay, with
an inarticulate curse more horrible than any
words could make it. With a shiver the child
slipped behind Henderson&#8217;s back and hid her
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be skeered o&#8217; him, kid, not one little
mite,&#8221; said Henderson, gently. &#8220;He ain&#8217;t agoin&#8217;
to trouble this earth no more. An&#8217; I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to get
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
yer father a job, helpin&#8217; me, down somewheres near
Greensville&ndash;&ndash;because I couldn&#8217;t sleep nights knowin&#8217;
ye was runnin&#8217; round anywheres near that hell-hole
yonder!&#8221;</p>

<h2><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>The Iron Edge of Winter</span></h2>
</div>
<p>The glory of the leaves was gone; the glory of
the snow was not yet come; and the world,
smitten with bitter frost, was grey like steel. The
ice was black and clear and vitreous on the forest
pools. The clods on the ploughed field, the broken
hillocks in the pasture, the ruts of the winding backwoods
road, were hard as iron and rang under the
travelling hoof. The silent, naked woods, moved
only by the bleak wind drawing through them from
the north, seemed as if life had forgotten them.</p>
<p>Suddenly there came a light thud, thud, thud, with
a pattering of brittle leaves; and a leisurely rabbit
hopped by, apparently on no special errand. At
the first of the sounds, a small, ruddy head with
bulging, big, bright eyes had appeared at the mouth
of a hole under the roots of an ancient maple. The
bright eyes noted the rabbit at once, and peered
about anxiously to see if any enemy were following.
There was no danger in sight.</p>
<p>Within two or three feet of the hole under the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
maple the rabbit stopped, sat up as if begging,
waved its great ears to and fro, and glanced around
inquiringly with its protruding, foolish eyes. As
it sat up, it felt beneath its whitey fluff of a tail
something hard which was not a stone, and promptly
dropped down again on all fours to investigate.
Poking its nose among the leaves and scratching with
its fore-paws, it uncovered a pile of beech-nuts, at
which it began to sniff. The next instant, with
a shrill, chattering torrent of invective, a red squirrel
whisked out from the hole under the maple, and
made as if to fly in the face of the big, good-natured
trespasser. Startled and abashed by this noisy
assault, the rabbit went bounding away over the
dead leaves and disappeared among the desolate
grey arches.</p>
<p>The silence was effectually dispelled. Shrieking
and scolding hysterically, flicking his long
tail in spasmodic jerks, and calling the dead
solitudes to witness that the imbecile intruder had
uncovered one of his treasure-heaps, the angry
squirrel ran up and down the trunk for at least two
minutes. Then, his feelings somewhat relieved by
this violent outburst, he set himself to gathering
the scattered nuts and bestowing them in new and
safer hiding-places.</p>
<p>In this task he had little regard for convenience,
and time appeared to be no object whatever. Some
of the nuts he took over to a big elm fifty paces distant,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
and jammed them one by one, solidly and conscientiously,
into the crevices of the bark. Others
he carried in the opposite direction, to the edge of
the open where the road ran by. These he hid under
a stone, where the passing wayfarer might step over
them, indeed, but would never think of looking for
them. While he was thus occupied, an old countryman
slouched by, his heavy boots making a noise on
the frozen ruts, his nose red with the harsh, unmitigated
cold. The squirrel, mounted on a fence
stake, greeted him with a flood of whistling and shrieking
abuse; and he, not versed in the squirrel tongue,
muttered to himself half enviously: &#8220;Queer how
them squur&#8217;ls can keep so cheerful in this weather.&#8221;
The tireless little animal followed him along
the fence rails for perhaps a hundred yards, seeing
him off the premises and advising him not to return,
then went back in high feather to his task. When
all the nuts were once more safely hidden but two
or three, these latter he carried to the top of a stump
close beside the hole in the maple, and proceeded
to make a meal. The stump commanded a view
on all sides; and as he sat up with a nut between
his little, hand-like, clever fore-paws, his shining eyes
kept watch on every path by which an enemy might
approach.</p>
<p>Having finished the nuts, and scratched his ears,
and jumped twice around on the stump as if he were
full of erratically acting springs, he uttered his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
satisfaction in a long, vibrant chir-r-r-r, and started
to re-enter his hole in the maple-roots. Just at the
door, however, he changed his mind. For no apparent
reason he whisked about, scurried across the
ground to the big elm, ran straight up the tall trunk,
and disappeared within what looked like a mass of
sticks perched among the topmost branches.</p>
<p>The mass of sticks was a deserted crow&#8217;s nest,
which the squirrel, not content with one dwelling,
had made over to suit his own personal needs. He
had greatly improved upon the architecture of the
crows, giving the nest a tight roof of twigs and moss,
and lining the snug interior with fine dry grass and
soft fibres of cedar-bark. In this secure and softly
swaying refuge, far above the reach of prowling
foxes, he curled himself up for a nap after his toil.</p>
<p>He slept well, but not long; for the red squirrel
has always something on his mind to see to. In
less than half an hour he whisked out again in great
excitement, jumped from branch to branch till he
was many yards from his own tree, and then
burst forth into vehement chatter. He must have
dreamed that some one was rifling his hoards, for
he ran eagerly from one hiding-place to another
and examined them all suspiciously. As he had
at least two-score to inspect, it took him some time;
but not till he had looked at every one did he seem
satisfied. Then he grew very angry, and scolded and
chirruped, as if he thought some one had made a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
fool of him. That he had made a fool of himself
probably never entered his confident and self-sufficient
little head.</p>
<p>While indulging this noisy volubility he was
seated on the top of his dining-stump. Suddenly he
caught sight of something that smote him into silence
and for the space of a second turned him to stone.
A few paces away was a weasel, gliding toward
him like a streak of baleful light. For one second
only he crouched. Then his faculties returned, and
launching himself through the air he landed on the
trunk of the maple and darted up among the branches.</p>
<p>No less swiftly the weasel followed, hungry,
bloodthirsty, relentless on the trail. Terrified into
folly by the suddenness and deadliness of this peril,
the squirrel ran too far up the tree and was almost
cornered. Where the branches were small there
was no chance to swing to another tree. Perceiving
this mistake, he gave a squeak of terror, then
bounded madly right over his enemy&#8217;s head, and
was lucky enough to catch foothold far out on a
lower branch. Recovering himself in an instant,
he shot into the next tree, and thence to the next
and the next. Then, breathless from panic rather
than from exhaustion, he crouched trembling behind
a branch and waited.</p>
<p>The weasel pursued more slowly, but inexorably
as doom itself. He was not so clever at branch-jumping
as his intended prey, but he was not to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
shaken off. In less than a minute he was following
the scent up the tree wherein the squirrel was hiding;
and again the squirrel dashed off in his desperate
flight. Twice more was this repeated, the squirrel
each time more panic-stricken and with less power
in nerve or muscle. Then wisdom forsook his brain
utterly. He fled straight to his elm and darted into
his nest in the swaying top. The weasel, running
lithely up the ragged trunk, knew that the chase
was at an end. From this cul de sac the squirrel
had no escape.</p>
<p>But Fate is whimsical in dealing with the wild
kindreds. She seems to delight in unlooked-for interventions.
While the squirrel trembled in his dark
nest, and the weasel, intent upon the first taste of
warm blood in his throat, ran heedlessly up a bare
stretch of the trunk, there came the chance which a
foraging hawk had been waiting for. The hawk,
too, had been following this breathless chase, but
ever baffled by intervening branches. Now he
swooped and struck. His talons had the grip of
steel. The weasel, plucked irresistibly from his
foothold, was carried off writhing to make the great
bird&#8217;s feast. And the squirrel, realizing at last that
the expected doom had been somehow turned aside,
came out and chattered feebly of his triumph.</p>

</div>
<p>The roar of the falls, the lighter and shriller
raging of the rapids, had at last died out
behind the thick masses of the forest, as Barnes
worked his way down the valley. The heat in the
windless underbrush, alive with insects, was stifling.
He decided to make once more for the bank of the
stream, in the hope that its character might by
this time have changed, so as to afford him an easier
and more open path. Pressing aside to his left,
he presently saw the green gloom lighten before
him. Blue sky and golden light came low through
the thinning trees, and then a gleam of unruffled
water. He was nearing the edge now; and because
the underbrush was so thick about him he began
to go cautiously.</p>
<p>All at once, he felt his feet sinking; and the screen
of thick bushes before him leaned away as if bowed
by a heavy gust. Desperately he clutched with
both hands at the undergrowth and saplings on
either side; but they all gave way with him. In
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
a smother of leafage and blinding, lashing branches
he sank downwards&ndash;&ndash;at first, as it seemed, slowly,
for he had time to think many things while his heart
was jumping in his throat. Then, shooting through
the lighter bushy companions of his fall, and still
clutching convulsively at those upon which he had
been able to lay his grasp, he plunged feet first
into a dark water.</p>
<p>The water was deep and cold. Barnes went
down straight, and clear under, with a strangled
gasp. His feet struck, with some force, upon a
tangled, yielding mass, from which he rose again
with a spring. His head shot up above the surface,
above the swirl of foam, leafage, and d&eacute;bris; and
splutteringly he gulped his lungs full of air. But
before he could clear his eyes or his nostrils, or
recover his self-possession, he was stealthily dragged
down again. And with a pang of horror he realized
that he was caught by the foot.</p>
<p>A powerful swimmer, Barnes struck out mightily
with his arms and came to the surface again at
once, rising beyond the shoulders. But by so much
the more was he violently snatched back again,
strangling and desperate, before he had time to
empty his lungs and catch breath. This time the
shock sobered him, flashing the full peril of the
situation before his startled consciousness. With
a tremendous effort of will he stopped his
struggling, and contented himself with a gentle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
paddling to keep upright. This time he came more
softly to the surface, clear beyond the chin. The
foam and d&eacute;bris and turbulence of little waves
seethed about his lips, and the sunlight danced confusingly
in his streaming eyes; but he gulped a fresh
lungful before he again went under.</p>

&#8220;<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>He realized that he was caught by the foot.</span>&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>Paddling warily now, he emerged again at once,
and, with arms outspread, brought himself to a
precarious equilibrium, his mouth just above the
surface so long as he held his head well back. Keeping
very still, he let his bewildered wits clear, and
the agitated surface settle to quiet.</p>
<p>He was in a deep, tranquil cove, hardly stirred
by an eddy. Some ten paces farther out from
shore the main current swirled past sullenly,
as if weary from the riot of falls and rapids.
Across the current a little space of sand-beach,
jutting out from the leafy shore, shone golden in
the sun. Up and down the stream, as far as his
extremely restricted vision would suffer him to see,
nothing but thick, overhanging branches, and the
sullen current. Very cautiously he turned his
head&ndash;&ndash;though to do so brought the water over his
lips&ndash;&ndash;and saw behind him just what he expected.
The high, almost perpendicular bank was scarred
by a gash of bright, raw, reddish earth, where the
brink had slipped away beneath his weight.</p>
<p>Just within reach of his hand lay, half submerged,
the thick, leafy top of a fallen poplar sapling, its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
roots apparently still clinging to the bank. Gently
he laid hold of it, testing it, in the hope that it
might prove solid enough to enable him to haul
himself out. But it came away instantly in his
grasp. And once more, in this slight disturbance
of his equilibrium, his head went under.</p>
<p>Barnes was disappointed, but he was now absolutely
master of his self-possession. In a moment
he had regained the only position in which he could
breathe comfortably. Then, because the sun was
beating down too fiercely on the top of his head, he
carefully drew the bushy top of the poplar sapling
into such a position that it gave him shade. As its
roots were still aground, it showed no tendency to
float off and forsake him in his plight.</p>
<p>A very little consideration, accompanied by a
cautious investigation with his free foot, speedily
convinced Barnes, who was a practical woodsman,
that the trap in which he found himself caught could
be nothing else than a couple of interlaced, twisted
branches, or roots, of some tree which had fallen
into the pool in a former caving-in of the bank.
In that dark deep wherein his foot was held fast,
his mind&#8217;s eye could see it all well enough&ndash;&ndash;the
water-soaked, brown-green, slimy, inexorable coil,
which had yielded to admit the unlucky member,
then closed upon the ankle like the jaws of an otter
trap. He could feel that grip&ndash;&ndash;not severe, but
uncompromisingly firm, clutching the joint. As he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
considered, he began to draw comfort, however,
from the fact that his invisible captor had displayed
a certain amount of give and take. This elasticity
meant either that it was a couple of branches slight
enough to be flexible that held him, or that the submerged
tree itself was a small one, not too steadfastly
anchored down. He would free himself easily
enough, he thought, as soon as he should set himself
about it coolly and systematically.</p>
<p>Taking a long breath he sank his head under the
surface, and peered downward through the amber-brown
but transparent gloom. Little gleams of
brighter light came twisting and quivering in from the
swirls of the outer current. Barnes could not discern
the bottom of the pool, which was evidently
very deep; but he could see quite clearly the
portion of the sunken tree in whose interwoven
branches he was held. A shimmering golden ray
fell just on the spot where his foot vanished to
the ankle between two stout curves of what looked
like slimy brown cable or sections of a tense snake
body.</p>
<p>It was, beyond question, a nasty-looking trap;
and Barnes could not blink the fact that he was in
a tight place. He lifted his face above the surface,
steadied himself carefully, and breathed deeply and
quietly for a couple of minutes, gathering strength
for a swift and vigorous effort. Then, filling his
lungs very moderately, the better to endure a strain,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
he stooped suddenly downward, deep into the yellow
gloom, and began wrenching with all his force at
those oozy curves, striving to drag them apart.
They gave a little, but not enough to release the
imprisoned foot. Another moment, and he had to
lift his head again for breath.</p>
<p>After some minutes of rest, he repeated the
choking struggle, but, as before, in vain. He could
move the jaws of the trap just enough to encourage
him a little, but not enough to gain his release.
Again and again he tried it, again and again to
fail just as he imagined himself on the verge of success;
till at last he was forced, for the moment,
to acknowledge defeat, finding himself so exhausted
that he could hardly keep his mouth above water.
Drawing down a stiffish branch of the sapling,
he gripped it between his teeth and so held himself
upright while he rested his arms. This was
a relief to nerves as well as muscles, because it
made his balance, on which he depended for the
chance to breathe, so much the less precarious.</p>
<p>As he hung there pondering, held but a bare half-inch
above drowning, the desperateness of the situation
presented itself to him in appalling clearness.
How sunny and warm and safe, to his woods-familiar
eyes, looked the green forest world about him. No
sound broke the mild tranquillity of the solitude,
except, now and then, an elfish gurgle of the slow
current, or the sweetly cheerful <i>tsic-a-dee-dee</i> of an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
unseen chicadee, or, from the intense blue overhead,
the abrupt, thin whistle of a soaring fish-hawk.
To Barnes it all seemed such a safe, friendly world,
his well-understood intimate since small boyhood.
Yet here it was, apparently, turned smooth traitor
at last, and about to destroy him as pitilessly as
might the most scorching desert or blizzard-scourged
ice-field. A silent rage burned suddenly
through all his veins&ndash;&ndash;which was well, since the
cold of that spring-fed river had already begun to
finger stealthily about his heart. A delicate little
pale-blue butterfly, like a periwinkle-petal come to
life, fluttered over Barnes&#8217;s grim, upturned face,
and went dancing gaily out across the shining water,
joyous in the sun. In its dancing it chanced to
dip a hair&#8217;s-breadth too low. The treacherous,
bright surface caught it, held it; and away it swept,
struggling in helpless consternation against this
unexpected doom. Before it passed out of Barnes&#8217;s
vision a great trout rose and gulped it down. Its
swift fate, to Barnes&#8217;s haggard eyes, seemed an
analogue in little to his own.</p>
<p>But it was not in the woodsman&#8217;s fibre to acknowledge
himself actually beaten, either by man or
fate, so long as there remained a spark in his brain
to keep his will alive. He presently began searching
with his eyes among the branches of the poplar
sapling for one stout enough to serve him as a
lever. With the right kind of a stick in his hand,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
he told himself, he might manage to pry apart the
jaws of the trap and get his foot free. At last
his choice settled upon a branch that he thought
would serve his turn. He was just about to
reach up and break it off, when a slight crackling
in the underbrush across the stream caught
his ear.</p>
<p>His woodsman&#8217;s instinct kept him motionless as
he turned his eyes to the spot. In the thick leafage
there was a swaying, which moved down along the
bank, but he could not see what was causing it.
Softly he drew over a leafy branch of the sapling
till it made him a perfect screen, then he peered up
the channel to find out what the unseen wayfarer
was following.</p>
<p>A huge salmon, battered and gashed from a vain
struggle to leap the falls, was floating, belly-upward,
down the current, close to Barnes&#8217;s side of the
stream. A gentle eddy caught it, and drew it into
the pool. Sluggishly it came drifting down toward
Barnes&#8217;s hidden face. In the twigs of the poplar
sapling it came to a halt, its great scarlet gills barely
moving as the last of life flickered out of it.</p>
<p>Barnes now understood quite well that unseen
commotion which had followed, along shore, the
course of the dying salmon. It was no surprise to
him whatever when he saw a huge black bear
emerge upon the yellow sandspit and stand staring
across the current. Apparently, it was staring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
straight at Barnes&#8217;s face, upturned upon the surface
of the water. But Barnes knew it was staring at
the dead salmon. His heart jumped sickeningly
with sudden hope, as an extravagant notion flashed
into his brain. Here was his rescuer&ndash;&ndash;a perilous
one, to be sure&ndash;&ndash;vouchsafed to him by some whim
of the inscrutable forest-fates.</p>
<p>He drew down another branchy twig before his
face, fearful lest his concealment should not be adequate.
But in his excitement he disturbed his
balance, and with the effort of his recovery the water
swirled noticeably all about him. His heart sank.
Assuredly, the bear would take alarm at this and be
afraid to come for the fish.</p>
<p>But to his surprise the great beast, which had
seemed to hesitate, plunged impetuously into the
stream. Nothing, according to a bear&#8217;s knowledge
of life, could have made that sudden disturbance in
the pool but some fish-loving otter or mink, intent
upon seizing the booty. Indignant at the prospect
of being forestalled by any such furtive marauder,
the bear hurled himself forward with such force that
the spray flew high into the branches, and the noise
of his splashing was a clear notification that trespassers
and meddlers had better keep off. That
salmon was his, by right of discovery; and he was
going to have it.</p>
<p>The bear, for all the seeming clumsiness of his
bulk, was a redoubtable swimmer; and almost
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
before Barnes had decided clearly on his proper
course of action those heavy, grunting snorts and
vast expulsions of breath were at his ear. Enormously
loud they sounded, shot thus close along the
surface of the water. Perforce, Barnes made up his
mind on the instant.</p>
<p>The bunch of twigs which had arrested the progress
of the floating salmon lay just about an arm&#8217;s
length from Barnes&#8217;s face. Swimming high, his
mighty shoulders thrusting up a wave before him
which buried Barnes&#8217;s head safely from view, the
bear reached the salmon. Grabbing it triumphantly
in his jaws, he turned to make for shore again.</p>
<p>This was Barnes&#8217;s moment. Both arms shot
out before him. Through the suffocating confusion
his clutching fingers encountered the bear&#8217;s haunches.
Sinking into the long fur, they closed upon it with
a grip of steel. Then, instinctively, Barnes shut his
eyes and clenched his teeth, and waited for the shock,
while his lungs felt as if they would burst in another
moment.</p>
<p>But it was no long time he had to wait&ndash;&ndash;perhaps
two seconds, while amazement in the bear&#8217;s brain
translated itself through panic into action. Utterly
horrified by this inexplicable attack, from the rear
and from the depths, the bear threw himself shoulder
high from the water, and hurled himself forward
with all his strength. Barnes felt those tremendous
haunches heaving irresistibly beneath his clutching
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
fingers. He felt himself drawn out straight, and
dragged ahead till he thought his ankle would snap.
Almost he came to letting go, to save the ankle. But
he held, on, as much with his will as with his grip.
Then, the slimy thing in the depths gave way. He
felt himself being jerked through the water&ndash;&ndash;free.
His fingers relaxed their clutch on the bear&#8217;s fur&ndash;&ndash;and
he came to the surface, gasping, blinking, and
coughing.</p>
<p>For a moment or two he paddled softly, recovering
his breath and shaking the water from nostrils
and eyes. He had an instant of apprehensiveness,
lest the bear should turn upon him and attack him
at a disadvantage; and by way of precaution he
gave forth the most savage and piercing yell that
his labouring lungs were capable of. But he saw
at once that on this score he had nothing to fear. It
was a well-frightened bear, there swimming frantically
for the sandspit; while the dead salmon, quite
forgotten, was drifting slowly away on the sullen
current.</p>
<p>Barnes&#8217;s foot was hurting fiercely, but his heart
was light. Swimming at leisure, so as to just keep
head against the stream, he watched the bear scuttle
out upon the sand. Once safe on dry land, the great
beast turned and glanced back with a timid air to
see what manner of being it was that had so astoundingly
assailed him. Man he had seen before&ndash;&ndash;but
never man swimming like an otter; and the sight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
was nothing to reassure him. One longing look he
cast upon the salmon, now floating some distance
away; but that, to his startled mind, was just a lure
of this same terrifying and perfidious creature
whose bright grey eyes were staring at him so
steadily from the surface of the water. He turned
quickly and made off into the woods, followed by
a loud, daunting laugh which spurred his pace to a
panicky gallop.</p>
<p>When he was gone, Barnes swam to the sandspit.
There he wrung out his dripping clothes, and lay
down in the hot sand to let the sun soak deep into
his chilled veins.</p>

<h2><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>The Nest of the Mallard</span></h2>
</div>
<p>When the spring freshet went down, and the
rushes sprang green all about the edges of the
shallow, marshy lagoons, a pair of mallards took
possession of a tiny, bushy island in the centre of
the broadest pond. Moved by one of those inexplicable
caprices which keep most of the wild
kindreds from too perilous an enslavement to
routine, this pair had been attracted by the vast,
empty levels of marsh and mere, and had dropped
out from the ranks of their northward-journeying
comrades. Why should they beat on through
the raw, blustering spring winds to Labrador,
when here below them was such a nesting-place
as they desired, with solitude and security and
plenty. The flock went on, obeying an ancestral
summons. With heads straight out before,
and rigid, level necks&ndash;&ndash;with web feet folded like
fans and stretched straight out behind, rigid and
level&ndash;&ndash;they sped through the air on short, powerful,
swift-beating wings at the rate of sixty or seventy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
miles an hour. Their flight, indeed, and their terrific
speed were not unlike those of some strange
missile. The pair who had dropped behind paid no
heed to their going; and in two minutes they had
faded out against the pale saffron morning sky.</p>
<p>These two were the only mallards in this whole
wide expanse of grass and water. Other kinds of
ducks there were, in plenty, but the mallards at this
season kept to themselves. The little island which
they selected for their peculiar domain was so
small that no other mating couples intruded upon
its privacy. It was only about ten feet across;
but it bore a favourable thicket of osier-willow, and
all around it the sedge and bulrush reared an impenetrable
screen. Its highest point was about two
feet above average water level; and on this highest
point the mallard duck established her nest.</p>
<p>The nest was a mere shallow pile of dead leaves
and twigs and dry sedges, scraped carelessly together.
But the inside was not careless. It was
a round smooth hollow, most softly lined with down
from the duck&#8217;s own breast. When the first pale,
greenish-tinted egg was laid in the nest, there was
only a little of this down; but the delicate and warm
lining accumulated as the pale green eggs increased
in number.</p>
<p>In the construction of the nest and the accumulation
of the eggs no interest whatever was displayed
by the splendid drake. He never, unless by chance,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
went near it. But as a lover the lordly fellow was
most gallant and ardent. While his mate was on
the nest laying, he was usually to be seen floating
on the open mere beyond the reed-fringe, pruning his
plumage in the cold pink rays of the first of the sunrise.</p>
<p>It was plumage well worth pruning, this of his,
and fully justified his pride in it. The shining, silken,
iridescent dark green of the head and neck; the
snowy, sharply defined, narrow collar of white,
dividing the green of the neck from the brownish
ash of the back and the gorgeous chestnut of the
breast; the delicate pure grey of the belly finely pencilled
with black lines; the rich, glossy purple
of the broad wing-bars shot with green reflections;
the jaunty, recurved black feathers of the tail;
the smart, citron-yellow of the bill and feet;&ndash;&ndash;all
these charms were ample excuse for his coxcombry
and continual posings. They were ample excuse,
too, for the admiration bestowed upon him by his
mottled brown mate, whose colours were obviously
designed not for show but for concealment. When
sitting on her nest, she was practically indistinguishable
from the twigs and dead leaves that surrounded
her.</p>
<p>Having laid her egg, the brown duck would cover
the precious contents of the nest with twigs and leaves,
that they might not be betrayed by their conspicuous
colour. Then she would steal, silently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
as a shadow, through the willow stems to the water&#8217;s
edge, and paddle cautiously out through the rushes
to the open water. On reaching her mate all this
caution would be laid aside, and the two would set
up an animated and confidential quacking. They
would sometimes sail around each other slowly in
circles, with much arching of necks and quaint stiff
bowing of heads; and sometimes they would chase
each other in scurrying, napping rushes along the
bright surface of the water. Both before and after
these gay exercises they would feed quietly in the
shallows, pulling up water-weed sprouts and tender
roots, or sifting insects and little shellfish from the
mud by means of the sensitive tips and guttered
edges of their bills. The mallard pair had few enemies
to dread, their island being so far from shore that no
four-footed marauder, not even the semi-amphibious
mink himself, ever visited it. And the region was
one too remote for the visits of the pot-hunter. In
fact, there was only one foe against whom it behoved
them to be on ceaseless guard. This was that bloodthirsty
and tireless slayer, the goshawk, or great
grey henhawk. Where that grim peril was concerned,
the brown duck would take no risks. For
the sake of those eggs among the willow stems, she
held her life very dear, never flying more than a short
circle around the island to stretch her wings, never
swimming or feeding any distance from the safe covert
of the rushes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></p>
<p>But with the glowing drake it was different.
High spirited, bold for all his wariness, and magnificently
strong of wing, from sheer restlessness he
occasionally flew high above the ponds. And one
day, when some distance from home, the great hawk
saw him and swooped down upon him from a&euml;rial
heights.</p>
<p>The impending doom caught the drake&#8217;s eye in
time for him to avoid the stroke of that irresistible
descent. His short wings, with their muscles of
steel, winnowed the air with sudden, tremendous
force, and he shot ahead at a speed which must
have reached the rate of a hundred miles an
hour. When the swooping hawk had rushed
down to his level, he was nearly fifty yards in
the lead.</p>
<p>In such a case most of the larger hawks would
have given up the chase, and soared again to abide
the chance for a more fortunate swoop. But not
so the implacable goshawk. His great pinions were
capable not only of soaring and sailing and swooping,
but of the rapid and violent flapping of the short-winged
birds; and he had at his command a speed
even greater than that of the rushing fugitive.
As he pursued, his wings tore the air with a strident,
hissing noise; and the speed of the drake seemed
as nothing before that savage, inescapable onrush.
Had the drake been above open water, he would
have hurled himself straight downward, and seized
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
the one chance of escape by diving; but beneath
him at this moment there was nothing but naked
swamp and sloppy flats. In less than two minutes
the hiss of the pursuing wings was close behind him.
He gave a hoarse squawk, as he realized that doom
had overtaken him. Then one set of piercing
talons clutched his outstretched neck, cutting clean
through his wind-pipe; and another set bit deep
into the glossy chestnut of his breast.</p>
<p>For several days the widowed duck kept calling
loudly up and down the edges of the reeds&ndash;&ndash;but at
a safe distance from the nest. When she went to
lay, she stayed ever longer and longer on the eggs,
brooding them. Three more eggs she laid after
the disappearance of her mate, and then, having
nine in the nest, she began to sit; and the open water
beyond the reed fringes saw her no more.</p>
<p>At first she would slip off the nest for a few minutes
every day, very stealthily, to feed and stretch and
take a noiseless dip in the shallow water among the
reeds; but as time went on she left the eggs only
once in two days. Twice a day she would turn the
eggs over carefully, and at the same time change
their respective positions in the nest, so that those
which had been for some hours in the centre, close
to her hot and almost naked breast, might take their
turn in the cooler space just under her wings. By
this means each egg got its fair share of heat,
properly distributed, and the little life taking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
shape within escaped the distortion which might
have been caused by lying too long in one position.
Whenever the wary brown mother left the nest, she
covered the eggs with down, now, which kept the
warmth in better than leaves could. And whenever
she came back from her brief swim, her dripping
feathers supplied the eggs with needed moisture.</p>
<p>It is a general law that the older an egg is the longer
it takes to hatch. The eggs of the mallard mother,
of course, varied in age from fifteen days to one
before she began to sit. This being the case, at
the end of the long month of incubation they would
have hatched at intervals covering in all, perhaps,
a full day and a half; and complications
would have arisen. But the wise mother had counteracted
the working of the law by sitting a little while
every day. Therefore, as a matter of fact, the
older eggs got the larger share of the brooding, in
exact proportion; and the building of the little
lives within the shells went on with almost perfect
uniformity.</p>
<p>During the long, silent month of her patient
brooding, spring had wandered away and summer
had spread thick green and yellow lily blooms all
over the lonely meres. A bland but heavy heat came
down through the willow tops, so that the brown
duck sometimes panted at her task, and sat with
open bill, or with wings half raised from the eggs.
Then, one night, she heard faint tappings and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
peepings beneath her. Sturdy young bills began
chipping at the inside of the shells, speedily
breaking them. Each duckling, as he chipped the
shell just before the tip of his beak, would turn a
little way around in his narrow quarters; till presently
the shell would fall apart, neatly divided into
halves; and the wet duckling, tumbling forth, would
snuggle up against the mother&#8217;s hot breast and
thighs to dry. Whenever this happened, the wise
mother would reach her head beneath, and fit the
two halves of shell one within the other, or else thrust
them out of the nest entirely, lest they should
get slipped over another egg and smother the
occupant. Sometimes she fitted several sets of
the empty shells together, that they might take
up less room; and altogether she showed that she
perfectly understood her business. Then, late in
the morning, when the green world among the
willows and rushes was still and warm and sweet,
she led her fluffy, sturdy brood straight down to the
water, and taught them to feed on the insects that
clung to the bulrush stalks.</p>

<h2><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Mrs. Gammit and the Porcupines</span></h2>
</div>
<p>&#8220;I hain&#8217;t come to borry yer gun, Mr. Barron,
but to ax yer advice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gammit&#8217;s rare appearances were always
abrupt, like her speech; and it was without surprise&ndash;&ndash;though
he had not seen her for a month or
more&ndash;&ndash;that Joe Barron turned to greet her.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s at yer sarvice, jest as the gun would be ef
ye wanted it, Mrs. Gammit&ndash;&ndash;<i>an&#8217;</i> welcome! But
come in an&#8217; set down an&#8217; git cooled off a mite. &#8217;Tain&#8217;t
no place to talk, out here in the bilin&#8217; sun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gammit seated herself on the end of the bench,
just inside the kitchen door, twitched off her limp,
pink cotton sunbonnet, and wiped her flushed
face with the sleeve of her calico waist. Quite
unsubdued by the heat and moisture of the noonday
sun, under which she had tramped nine miles
through the forest, her short, stiff, grey hair stood
up in irregular tufts above her weather-beaten
forehead. Her host, sitting sidewise on the edge
of the table so that he could swing one leg freely and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
spit cleanly through the open window, bit off
a contemplative quid of &#8220;blackjack&#8221; tobacco, and
waited for her to unfold the problems that troubled
her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gammit&#8217;s rugged features were modelled
to fit an expression of vigorous, if not belligerent,
self-confidence. She knew her capabilities, well-tried
in some sixty odd years of unprotected spinsterhood.
Merit alone, not matrimony, it was, that
had crowned this unsullied spinsterhood with the
honorary title of &#8220;Mrs.&#8221; Her massive and energetic
nose was usually carried somewhat high, in a
not unjustifiable scorn of such foolish circumstance
as might seek to thwart her will.</p>
<p>But to-day these strenuous features found themselves
surprised by an expression of doubt, of
bewilderment, almost one might say of humility.
At her little clearing in the heart of the great wilderness
things had been happening which, to her
amazement, she could not understand. Hitherto
she had found an explanation, clear at least to
herself, for everything that befell her in these silent
backwoods which other folks seemed to find so
absurdly mysterious. Armed with her self-confidence
she had been able, hitherto, to deal with
every situation that had challenged her, and in a
manner quite satisfactory to herself, however the
eternal verities may have smiled at it. But now,
at last, she was finding herself baffled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></p>
<p>Joe Barron waited with the patience of the backwoodsman
and the Indian, to whom, as to Nature
herself, time seems no object, though they always
somehow manage to be on time. Mrs. Gammit
continued to fan her hot face with her sunbonnet,
and to ponder her problems, while the lines deepened
between her eyes. A big black and yellow wasp
buzzed angrily against the window-pane, bewildered
because it could not get through the transparent
barrier. A little grey hen, with large, drooping
comb vividly scarlet, hopped on to the doorsill,
eyed Mrs. Gammit with surprise and disapprobation,
and ran away to warn the rest of the flock that
there was a woman round the place. That, as they
all knew by inheritance from the &#8220;shooings&#8221;
which their forefathers had suffered, meant that they
would no longer be allowed in the kitchen to pick
up crumbs.</p>
<p>At last Mrs. Gammit spoke&ndash;&ndash;but with difficulty,
for it came hard to her to ask advice of any one.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sp&#8217;ose now, mebbe, Mr. Barron, you know more
about the woods critters&#8217;n what I do?&#8221; she inquired,
hopefully but doubtfully.</p>
<p>The woodsman lifted his eyebrows in some surprise
at the question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, if I don&#8217;t I&#8217;d <i>oughter</i>,&#8221; said he, &#8220;seein&#8217;
as how I&#8217;ve kinder lived round amongst &#8217;em all my
life. If I know <i>anything</i>, it&#8217;s the backwoods an&#8217;
all what pertains to that same!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you&#8217;d <i>oughter</i> know more about them
than I do!&#8221; assented Mrs. Gammit, with a touch of
severity which seemed to add &#8220;and see that you do!&#8221;
Then she shut her mouth firmly and fell to fanning
herself again, her thoughts apparently far
away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope &#8217;tain&#8217;t no <i>serious</i> trouble ye&#8217;re in!&#8221;
ventured her host presently, with the amiable intention
of helping her to deliver her soul of its
burden.</p>
<p>But, manlike, he struck the wrong note.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you suppose,&#8221; snapped Mrs. Gammit, &#8220;I&#8217;d
be traipsin&#8217; over here nine mile thro&#8217; the hot woods
to ax yer advice, Mr. Barron, if <i>&#8217;twarn&#8217;t</i> serious?&#8221;
And she began to regret that she had come. Men
never did understand anything, anyway.</p>
<p>At this sudden acerbity the woodsman stroked his
chin with his hand, to hide the ghost of a smile which
flickered over his lean mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jest like a woman, to git riled over nawthin&#8217;!&#8221;
he thought. &#8220;Sounds kinder nice an&#8217; homey, too!&#8221;
But aloud, being always patient with the sex, he said
coaxingly&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;s right proud I am that ye should come
to me about it, Mrs. Gammit. I reckon I kin help
you out, mebbe. What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>With a burst of relief Mrs. Gammit declared her
sorrow.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the aigs,&#8221; said she, passionately. &#8220;Fer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
nigh on to a month, now, I&#8217;ve been alosin&#8217; of &#8217;em
as fast as the hens kin git &#8217;em laid. An&#8217; all I kin do,
I cain&#8217;t find out what&#8217;s atakin&#8217; &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having reached the point of asking advice, an
expression of pathetic hopefulness came into her
weather-beaten face. Under quite other conditions
it might almost have been possible for Mrs. Gammit
to learn to lean on a man, if he were careful not to
disagree with her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! Aigs!&#8221; said the woodsman, relaxing
slightly the tension of his sympathy. &#8220;Well, now,
let&#8217;s try an&#8217; git right to the root of the trouble.
Air ye plumb sure, in the first place, that the
hens is really <i>layin&#8217;</i> them aigs what ye don&#8217;t
git?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gammit stiffened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I look like an eejut?&#8221; she demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not one leetle mite, you don&#8217;t!&#8221; assented her
host, promptly and cordially.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was beginning to think mebbe I did!&#8221; persisted
the injured lady.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody knows,&#8221; protested the woodsman,
&#8220;as how what you don&#8217;t know, Mrs. Gammit, ain&#8217;t
hardly wuth knowin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O&#8217; course, that&#8217;s puttin&#8217; it a leetle too strong,
Mr. Barron,&#8221; she answered, much mollified. &#8220;But
I do reckon as how I&#8217;ve got <i>some</i> horse sense. Well,
I <i>thought</i> as how them &#8217;ere hens <i>might</i> &#8217;ave stopped
layin&#8217; on the suddint; so I up an&#8217; watched &#8217;em.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
Land&#8217;s sakes, but they was alayin&#8217; fine. Whenever
I kin take time to stan&#8217; right by an&#8217; <i>watch</i> &#8217;em lay, I
git all the aigs I know what to do with. But when
I <i>don&#8217;t</i> watch &#8217;em, <i>clost</i>&ndash;&ndash;nary an aig. Ye ain&#8217;t
agoin&#8217; to persuade me a hen kin jest quit layin&#8217; when
she&#8217;s a mind ter, waitin&#8217; tell ye pass her the compliment
o&#8217; holdin&#8217; out yer hand fer the aig!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s lots o&#8217; hens that pervarted they&#8217;ll
turn round an&#8217; <i>eat</i> their own aigs!&#8221; suggested the
woodsman, spitting thoughtfully through the open
window. The cat, coiled in the sun on a log outside,
sprang up angrily, glared with green eyes at
the offending window, and scurried away to cleanse
her defiled coat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Them&#8217;s not <i>my</i> poultry!&#8221; said Mrs. Gammit
with decision. &#8220;I thought o&#8217; that, too. An&#8217; I
watched &#8217;em on the sly. But they hain&#8217;t a one of
&#8217;em got no sech onnateral tricks. When they&#8217;re
through layin&#8217;, they jest hop off an&#8217; run away acacklin&#8217;,
as they should.&#8221; And she shook her head heavily,
as one almost despairing of enlightenment. &#8220;No,
ef ye ain&#8217;t got no more idees to suggest than that,
I might as well be goin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I was jest kinder clearin&#8217; out the underbrush,
so&#8217;s to git a square good look at the situation,&#8221;
explained Barron. &#8220;Now, I kin till ye somethin&#8217;
about it. Firstly, it&#8217;s a weasel, bein&#8217; so sly, an&#8217;
quick, an&#8217; audashus! Ten to one, it&#8217;s a weasel;
an&#8217; ye&#8217;ve got to trap it. Secondly, if &#8217;tain&#8217;t a weasel,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
it&#8217;s a fox, an&#8217; a <i>mighty</i> cute fox, as ye&#8217;re goin&#8217; to have
some trouble in aketchin&#8217;. An&#8217; thirdly&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; lastly&ndash;&ndash;if
&#8217;tain&#8217;t neither weasel nor fox, it&#8217;s jest bound to be
an extra cunnin&#8217; skunk, what&#8217;s takin&#8217; the trouble
to be keerful. Generally speakin&#8217;, skunks ain&#8217;t
keerful, because they don&#8217;t have to be, nobody
wantin&#8217; much to fool with &#8217;em. But onc&#8217;t in a
while ye&#8217;ll come across&#8217;t one that&#8217;s as sly as a
weasel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, &#8217;tain&#8217;t none o&#8217; them!&#8221; said Mrs. Gammit,
in a tone which conveyed a poor opinion of her host&#8217;s
sagacity and woodcraft. &#8220;I&#8217;ve suspicioned the
weasels, an&#8217; the foxes, an&#8217; the woodchucks, but hain&#8217;t
found a sign o&#8217; any one of &#8217;em round the place. An&#8217;
<i>as</i> fer <i>skunks</i>&ndash;&ndash;well, I reckon, I&#8217;ve got a nose
on my face.&#8221; And to emphasize the fact, she
sniffed scornfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure! An&#8217; a fine, handsome nose it is, Mrs.
Gammit!&#8221; replied the woodsman, diplomatically.
&#8220;But what you <i>don&#8217;t</i> appear to know about skunks
is that when they&#8217;re up to mischief is jest the
time when you don&#8217;t smell &#8217;em. Ye got to bear
that in mind!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gammit looked at him with suspicion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be that reelly so?&#8221; demanded she, sternly.</p>
<p>&#8220;True&#8217;s gospel!&#8221; answered Barron. &#8220;A skunk
ain&#8217;t got no smell unless he&#8217;s a mind to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said she, &#8220;I guess it ain&#8217;t no skunk, anyhow.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
I kind o&#8217; feel it in my bones &#8217;tain&#8217;t no skunk,
smell or no smell.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woodsman looked puzzled. He had not
imagined her capable of such unreasoning obstinacy.
He began to wonder if he had overrated her intelligence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I give it up, Mrs. Gammit,&#8221; said he, with
an air of having lost all interest in the problem.</p>
<p>But that did not suit his visitor at all. Her
manner became more conciliatory. Leaning forward,
with an almost coaxing look on her face, she murmured&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had an <i>idee</i> as how it <i>might</i> be&ndash;&ndash;mind, I
don&#8217;t say it is, but jest it <i>might</i> be&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; and she
paused dramatically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Might be what?&#8221; inquired Barron, with reviving
interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Porkypines!&#8221; propounded Mrs. Gammit, with
a sudden smile of triumph.</p>
<p>Joe Barron neither spoke nor smiled. But in
his silence there was something that made Mrs.
Gammit uneasy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why <i>not</i> porkypines?&#8221; she demanded, her face
once more growing severe.</p>
<p>&#8220;It <i>might</i> be porkypines as took them aigs o&#8217; yourn,
Mrs. Gammit, an&#8217; it <i>might be bumbly-bees</i>!&#8221; responded
Barron. &#8220;But &#8217;tain&#8217;t likely!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gammit snorted at the sarcasm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe,&#8221; she sneered, &#8220;ye kin tell me <i>why</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
it&#8217;s so impossible it could be porkypines. I seen a
big porkypine back o&#8217; the barn, only yestiddy. An&#8217;
that&#8217;s more&#8217;n kin be said o&#8217; yer weasels, an&#8217; foxes,
an&#8217; skunks, what ye&#8217;re so sure about, Mr. Barron.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A porkypine ain&#8217;t necess<i>ar</i>ily after aigs jest
because he&#8217;s back of a barn,&#8221; said the woodsman.
&#8220;An&#8217; anyways, a porkypine don&#8217;t eat aigs. He hain&#8217;t
got the right kind o&#8217; teeth fer them kind o&#8217; vittles.
He&#8217;s <i>got</i> to have something he kin gnaw on, somethin&#8217;
substantial an&#8217; solid&ndash;&ndash;the which he prefers a
young branch o&#8217; good tough spruce, though it <i>do</i>
make his meat kinder strong. No, Mrs. Gammit, it
ain&#8217;t no porkypine what&#8217;s stealin&#8217; yer aigs, take my
word fer it. An&#8217; the more I think o&#8217; it the surer I
be that it&#8217;s a weasel. When a weasel learns to suck
aigs, he gits powerful cute. Ye&#8217;ll have to be right
smart, I&#8217;m telling ye, to trap him.&#8221;</p>
<p>During this argument of Barron&#8217;s his obstinate
and offended listener had become quite convinced
of the justice of her own conclusions. The sarcasm
had settled it. She <i>knew</i>, now, that she
had been right all along in her suspicion of the porcupines.
And with this certainty her indignation
suddenly disappeared. It is <i>such</i> a comfort to be
certain. So now, instead of flinging his ignorance in
his face, she pretended to be convinced&ndash;&ndash;remembering
that she needed his advice as to how to trap the
presumptuous porcupine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Barron,&#8221; said she, with the air of one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
who would take defeat gracefully, &#8220;supposin&#8217; ye&#8217;re
right&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; ye&#8217;d <i>oughter</i> know&ndash;&ndash;how would ye go
about <i>ketchin&#8217;</i> them weasels?&#8221;</p>
<p>Pleased at this sudden return to sweet reasonableness,
the woodsman once more grew interested.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon we kin fix <i>that</i>!&#8221; said he, confidently
and cordially. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give ye three of my little mink
traps. There&#8217;s holes, I reckon, under the back an&#8217;
sides o&#8217; the shed, or barn, or wherever it is that the
hens have their nests?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nat&#8217;rally!&#8221; responded Mrs. Gammit. &#8220;The
thieves ain&#8217;t agoin&#8217; to come in by the front doors,
right under my nose, be they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; assented the woodsman. &#8220;Well,
you jest set them &#8217;ere traps in three o&#8217; them holes,
well under the sills an&#8217; out o&#8217; the way. Don&#8217;t go fer
to bait&#8217;em, mind, or Mr. Weasel&#8217;ll git to suspicionin&#8217;
somethin&#8217;, right off. Jest sprinkle bits of straw,
an&#8217; hayseed, an&#8217; sech rubbish over &#8217;em, so it all looks
no ways out o&#8217; the ordinary. You do this right,
Mrs. Gammit; an&#8217; first thing ye know ye&#8217;ll have yer
thief. I&#8217;ll git the traps right now, an&#8217; show ye how
to set &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>And as Mrs. Gammit walked away with the three
steel traps under her arm, she muttered to herself&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Joe Barron, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll show ye the thief. An&#8217;
he&#8217;ll have quills on him, sech as no <i>weasel</i> ain&#8217;t never
had on him, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>On her return, Mrs. Gammit was greeted by the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
sound of high excitement among the poultry. They
were all cackling wildly, and craning their necks to
stare into the shed as if they had just seen a ghost
there. Mrs. Gammit ran in to discover what all the
fuss was about. The place was empty; but a smashed
egg lay just outside one of the nests, and a generous
tuft of fresh feathers showed her that there had been
a tussle of some kind. Indignant but curious, Mrs.
Gammit picked up the feathers, and examined them
with discriminating eyes to see which hen had suffered
the loss.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lands sakes!&#8221; she exclaimed presently, &#8220;ef &#8217;tain&#8217;t
the old rooster! He&#8217;s made a fight fer that &#8217;ere aig!
Lucky he didn&#8217;t git stuck full o&#8217; quills!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, for perhaps the hundredth time, she ran
fiercely and noisily behind the barn, in the hope of
surprising the enemy. Of course she surprised nothing
which Nature had endowed with even the merest
apology for eyes and ears; and a cat-bird in the choke-cherry
bushes squawked at her derisively. Stealth
was one of the things which Mrs. Gammit did
not easily achieve. Staring defiantly about her,
her eyes fell upon a dark, bunchy creature in the
top of an old hemlock at the other side of the fence.
Seemingly quite indifferent to her vehement existence,
and engrossed in its own affairs, it was crawling out
upon a high branch and gnawing, in a casual way,
at the young twigs as it went.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, ha! What did I tell ye? I knowed all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
along as how it was a porkypine!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs.
Gammit, triumphantly, as if Joe Barron could hear
her across eight miles of woods. Then, as she eyed
the imperturbable animal on the limb above her, her
face flushed with quick rage, and snatching up a stone
about the size of her fist she hurled it at him with
all her strength.</p>
<p>In a calmer moment she would never have done
this&ndash;&ndash;not because it was rude, but because she had
a conviction, based on her own experience, that a
stone would hit anything rather than what it was
aimed at. And in the present instance she found no
reason to change her views on the subject. The
stone did not hit the porcupine. It did not, even
for one moment, distract his attention from the
hemlock twigs. Instead of that, it struck a low
branch, on the other side of the tree, and bounced
back briskly upon Mrs. Gammit&#8217;s toes.</p>
<p>With a hoarse squeak of surprise and pain the
good lady jumped backwards, and hopped for some
seconds on one foot while she gripped the other with
both hands. It was a sharp and disconcerting
blow. As the pain subsided a concentrated fury
took its place. The porcupine was now staring down
at her, in mild wonder at her inexplicable gyrations.
She glared up at him, and the tufts of grey hair about
her sunbonnet seemed to rise and stand rigid.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye think ye&#8217;re smart!&#8221; she muttered through
her set teeth. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll fix ye fer that! Jest you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
wait!&#8221; And turning on her heel she stalked back
to the house. The big, brown teapot was on the
back of the stove, where it had stood since breakfast,
with a brew rust-red and bitter-strong enough to
tan a moose-hide. Not until she had reheated it
and consumed five cups, sweetened with molasses,
did she recover any measure of self-complacency.</p>
<p>That same evening, when the last of the sunset was
fading in pale violet over the stump pasture and her
two cow-bells were <i>tonk-tonking</i> softly along the
edge of the dim alder swamp, Mrs. Gammit stealthily
placed the traps according to the woodsman&#8217;s directions.
Between the massive logs which formed the
foundations of the barn and shed, there were openings
numerous enough, and some of them spacious
enough, almost, to admit a bear&ndash;&ndash;a very small,
emaciated bear. Selecting three of these, which
somehow seemed to her fancy particularly adapted
to catch a porcupine&#8217;s taste, she set the traps,
tied them, and covered them lightly with fine rubbish
so that, as she murmured to herself when all was done,
&#8220;everythin&#8217; looked as nat&#8217;ral as nawthin&#8217;.&#8221; Then,
when her evening chores were finished, she betook
herself to her slumbers, in calm confidence that in the
morning she would find one or more porcupines in
the trap.</p>
<p>Having a clear conscience and a fine appetite, in
spite of the potency of her tea Mrs. Gammit slept
soundly. Nevertheless, along toward dawn, in that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
hour when dream and fact confuse themselves, her
nightcapped ears became aware of a strange sound
in the yard. She snorted impatiently and sat up in
bed. Could some beneficent creature of the night be
out there sawing wood for her? It sounded like it.
But she rejected the idea at once. Rubbing her
eyes with both fists, she crept to the window and
looked out.</p>
<p>There was a round moon in the sky, shining over
the roof of the barn, and the yard was full of a white,
witchy radiance. In the middle of it crouched
two big porcupines, gnawing assiduously at a
small wooden tub. The noise of their busy teeth on
the hard wood rang loud upon the stillness, and a
low <i>tonk-a-tonk</i> of cow-bells came from the pasture
as the cows lifted their heads to listen.</p>
<p>The tub was a perfectly good tub, and Mrs. Gammit
was indignant at seeing it eaten. It had contained
salt herrings; and she intended, after getting the flavour
of fish scoured out of it, to use it for packing her
winter&#8217;s butter. She did not know that it was for the
sake of its salty flavour that the porcupines were
gnawing at it, but leaped to the conclusion that
their sole object was to annoy and persecute herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shoo! Shoo!&#8221; she cried, snatching off her nightcap
and flapping it at them frantically. But the
animals were too busy to even look up at her. The
only sign they gave of having heard her was to raise
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
their quills straight on end so that their size apparently
doubled itself all at once.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gammit felt herself wronged. As she turned
and ran downstairs she muttered, &#8220;First it&#8217;s me aigs&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217;
now it&#8217;s me little tub&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; Lordy knows what
it&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be next!&#8221; Then her dauntless spirit
flamed up again, and she snapped, &#8220;But there ain&#8217;t
agoin&#8217; to be no next!&#8221; and cast her eyes about her
for the broom.</p>
<p>Of course, at this moment, when it was most
needed, that usually exemplary article was not where
it ought to have been&ndash;&ndash;standing beside the dresser.
Having no time to look for it, Mrs. Gammit snatched
up the potato-masher, and rushed forth into the moonlight
with a gurgling yell, resolved to save the
tub.</p>
<p>She was a formidable figure as she charged down
the yard, and at ordinary times the porcupines might
have given way. But when a porcupine has found
something it really likes to eat, its courage is superb.
These two porcupines found the herring-tub delicious
beyond anything they had ever tasted. Reluctantly
they stopped gnawing for a moment, and turned
their little twinkling eyes upon Mrs. Gammit in sullen
defiance.</p>
<p>Now this was by no means what she had expected,
and the ferocity of her attack slackened. Had it
been a lynx, or even a bear, her courage would probably
not have failed her. Had it been a man, a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
desperado with knife in hand and murder in his eyes,
she would have flown upon him in contemptuous
fury. But porcupines were different. They were
mysterious to her. She believed firmly that they
could shoot their quills, like arrows, to a distance
of ten feet. She had a swift vision of herself stuck
full of quills, like a pincushion. At a distance of
eleven feet she stopped abruptly, and hurled the
potato-masher with a deadly energy which carried
it clean over the barn. Then the porcupines resumed
their feasting, while she stared at them helplessly.
Two large tears of rage brimmed her eyes, and rolled
down her battered cheeks; and backing off a few
paces she sat down upon the saw-horse to consider
the situation.</p>
<p>But never would Mrs. Gammit have been what she
was had she been capable of acknowledging defeat.
In a very few moments her resourceful wits reasserted
themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;Queer!&#8221; she mused. &#8220;One don&#8217;t never kinder
seem to hit what one aims at! But one always hits
<i>somethin&#8217;</i>! Leastways, I do! If I jest fling enough
things, an&#8217; keep on aflingin&#8217;, I might hit a porkypine
jest as well as anything else. There ain&#8217;t nawthin&#8217;
onnateral about a porkypine, to keep one from
hitt&#8217;n&#8217; him, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>The wood-pile was close by; and the wood, which
she had sawed and split for the kitchen stove, was
of just the handy size. She was careful, now, not to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
take aim, but imagined herself anxious to establish
a new wood-pile, in haste, just about where that sound
of insolent gnawing was disturbing the night. In
a moment a shower of sizable firewood was dropping
all about the herring-tub.</p>
<p>The effect was instantaneous. The gnawing
stopped, and the porcupines glanced about uneasily.
A stick fell plump upon the bottom of the tub,
staving it in. The porcupines backed away and eyed
it with grieved suspicion. Another stick struck it
on the side, so that it bounced like a jumping, live
thing, and hit one of the porcupines sharply, rolling
him over on his back. Instantly his valiant quills
went down quite flat; and as he wriggled to his feet
with a squeak of alarm, he looked all at once little
and lean and dark, like a wet hen. Mrs. Gammit
smiled grimly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye ain&#8217;t feelin&#8217; quite so sassy now, be ye?&#8221;
she muttered; and the sticks flew the faster from
her energetic hands. Not many of them, to be sure,
went at all in the direction she wished, but enough
were dropping about the herring-tub to make the
porcupines remember that they had business elsewhere.
The one that had been struck had no longer
any regard for his dignity, but made himself as small
as possible and scurried off like a scared rat. The
other, unvanquished but indignant, withdrew slowly,
with every quill on end. The sticks fell all about him;
but Mrs. Gammit, in the excitement of her triumph,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
was now forgetting herself so far as to take aim,
therefore never a missile touched him. And presently,
without haste, he disappeared behind the
barn.</p>
<p>With something almost like admiration Mrs.
Gammit eyed his departure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, seein&#8217; as I hain&#8217;t scairt ye <i>much</i>,&#8221; she muttered
dryly, &#8220;mebbe ye&#8217;ll obleege me by coming back
an&#8217; gittin&#8217; into my trap. But ye ain&#8217;t agoin&#8217;
to hev no more o&#8217; my good herrin&#8217;-tub, ye ain&#8217;t.&#8221;
And she strode down the yard to get the tub. It
was no longer a good tub, for the porcupines had
gnawed two big holes in the sides, and Mrs. Gammit&#8217;s
own missiles had broken in the bottom. But she
obstinately bore the poor relics into the kitchen.
Firewood they might become, but not food for the
enemy.</p>
<p>No more that night was the good woman&#8217;s sleep
disturbed, and she slept later than usual. As she
was getting up, conscience-stricken at the sound of
the cows in the pasture lowing to be milked, she heard
a squawking and fluttering under the barn, and
rushed out half dressed to see what was the matter.
She had no doubt that one of the audacious porcupines
had got himself into a trap.</p>
<p>But no, it was neither porcupine, fox, nor weasel.
To her consternation, it was her old red top-knot
hen, which now lay flat upon the trap, with outstretched
wings, exhausted by its convulsive floppings.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
She picked it up, loosed the deadly grip
upon its leg, and slammed the offending trap across
the barn with such violence that it bounced up and
fell into the swill-barrel. Her feelings thus a little
relieved, she examined Red Top-knot&#8217;s leg with care.
It was hopelessly shattered and mangled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye cain&#8217;t never scratch with <i>that</i> ag&#8217;in, ye cain&#8217;t!&#8221;
muttered Mrs. Gammit, compassionately. &#8220;Poor
dear, ther ain&#8217;t nawthin&#8217; fer it but to make vittles
of ye now! Too bad! Too bad! Ye was always
sech a fine layer an&#8217; a right smart setter!&#8221; And
carrying the victim to the block on which she was
wont to split kindling wood, she gently but firmly
chopped her head off.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, as Mrs. Gammit returned from
the pasture with a brimming pail of milk, again she
heard a commotion under the barn. But she would
not hurry, lest she should spill the milk. &#8220;Whatever
it be, it&#8217;ll be there when I git there!&#8221; she muttered
philosophically; and kept on to the cool
cellar with her milk. But as soon as she had deposited
the pail she turned and fairly ran in her eagerness.
The speckled hen was cackling vain-gloriously;
and as Mrs. Gammit passed the row of
nests in the shed she saw a white egg shining. But
she did not stop to secure it.</p>
<p>As she entered the barn, a little yellowish brown
animal, with a sharp, triangular nose and savage
eyes like drops of fire, ran at her with such fury that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
for an instant she drew back. Then, with a roar
of indignation at its audacity, she rushed forward
and kicked at it. The kick struck empty air; but
the substantial dimensions of the foot seemed to
daunt the daring little beast, and it slipped away
like a darting flame beneath the sill of the barn.
The next moment, as she stooped to look at the nearest
of the two traps, another slim yellow creature,
larger than the first, leaped up, with a vicious cry,
and almost reached her face. But, fortunately for
her, it was held fast by both hind legs in the trap,
and fell back impotent.</p>
<p>Startled and enraged, Mrs. Gammit kicked at it,
where it lay darting and twisting like a snake. Naturally,
she missed it; but it did not miss her.
With unerring aim it caught the toe of her heavy cowhide
shoe, and fixed its teeth in the tough leather.
Utterly taken by surprise, Mrs. Gammit tried
to jump backwards. But instead of that, she
fell flat on her back, with a yell. Her sturdy heels
flew up in the air, while her petticoats flopped back
in her face, bewildering her. The weasel, however,
had maintained his dogged grip upon the toe of her
shoe; so something <i>had</i> to give. That something
was the cord which anchored the trap. It broke
under the sudden strain. Trap and weasel together
went flying over Mrs. Gammit&#8217;s prostrate head.
They brought up with a stupefying slam against
the wall of the pig-pen, making the pig squeal
apprehensively.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></p>
<p>Disconcerted and mortified, Mrs. Gammit scrambled
to her feet, shook her petticoats into shape, and
glanced about to see if the wilderness in general had
observed her indiscretion. Apparently, nothing
had noticed it. Then, with an air of relief, she
glanced down at her vicious little antagonist. The
weasel lay stunned, apparently dead. But she was
not going to trust appearances. Picking trap and
victim up together, on the end of a pitchfork, she
carried them out and dropped them into the barrel
of rain water at the corner of the house. Half-revived
by the shock, the yellow body wriggled for
a moment or two at the bottom of the barrel.
As she watched it, a doubt passed through Mrs.
Gammit&#8217;s mind. Could Joe Barron have been
right? <i>Was</i> it weasels, after all, that were taking
her eggs? But she dismissed the idea at once. Joe
Barron didn&#8217;t know everything! And there, indisputably,
were the porcupines, bothering her all
the time, with unheard-of impudence. Weasels, indeed!</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twa&#8217;n&#8217;t <i>you</i> I was after,&#8221; she muttered obstinately,
apostrophizing the now motionless form in
the rain-barrel. &#8220;It was them dratted porkypines,
as comes after my aigs. But <i>ye&#8217;re</i> a bad lot,
too, an&#8217; I&#8217;m right glad to have got ye where ye won&#8217;t
be up to no mischief.&#8221;</p>
<p>All athrill with excitement, Mrs. Gammit hurried
through her morning&#8217;s chores, and allowed herself no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
breakfast except half a dozen violent cups of tea
&#8220;with sweetenin&#8217;.&#8221; Then, satisfied that the weasel
in the rain-barrel was by this time securely and permanently
dead, she fished it out, and reset the trap
in its place under the barn. The other trap she discovered
in the swill-barrel, after a long search. Relieved
to find it unbroken, she cleaned it carefully
and put it away to be returned, in due time, to its
owner. She would not set it again&ndash;&ndash;and, indeed, she
would have liked to smash it to bits, as a sacrifice
to the memory of poor Red Top-knot.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hain&#8217;t got no manner o&#8217; use fer a porkypine
trap what&#8217;ll go out o&#8217; its way to ketch hens,&#8221; she
grumbled.</p>
<p>The silent summer forenoon, after this, wore
away without event. Mrs. Gammit, working in her
garden behind the house, with the hot, sweet scent
of the flowering buckwheat-field in her nostrils and
the drowsy hum of bees in her ears, would throw
down her hoe about once in every half-hour and run
into the barn to look hopefully at the traps. But
nothing came to disturb them. Neither did anything
come to disturb the hens, who attended so well
to business that at noon Mrs. Gammit had seven
fresh eggs to carry in. When night came, and
neither weasels nor porcupines had given any further
sign of their existence, Mrs. Gammit was puzzled.
She was one of those impetuous women who expect
everything to happen all at once. When milking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
was over, and her solitary, congenial supper, she sat
down on the kitchen doorstep and considered the
situation very carefully.</p>
<p>What she had set herself out to do, after the interview
with Joe Barron, was to catch a porcupine in
one of his traps, and thus, according to her peculiar
method of reasoning, convince the confident woodsman
that porcupines <i>did</i> eat eggs! As for the
episode of the weasel, she resolved that she would
not say anything to him about it, lest he should twist
it into a confirmation of his own views. As for
those seven eggs, so happily spared to her, she
argued that the capture of the weasel, with all its
attendant excitement, had served as a warning to
the porcupines and put them on their guard. Well,
she would give them something else to think about.
She was now all impatience, and felt unwilling to
await the developments of the morrow, which, after
all, might refuse to develop! With a sudden resolution
she arose, fetched the gnawed and battered
remains of the herring-tub from their concealment
behind the kitchen door, and propped them
up against the side of the house, directly beneath
her bedroom window.</p>
<p>At first her purpose in this was not quite clear to
herself. But the memory of her triumph of the
previous night was tingling in her veins, and she
only knew she wanted to lure the porcupines back,
that she might do <i>something</i> to them. And first,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
being a woman, that something occurred to her in
connexion with hot water. How conclusive it
would be to wait till the porcupines were absorbed
in their consumption of the herring-tub, and then
pour scalding water down upon them. After all,
it was more important that she should vanquish her
enemies than prove to a mere man that they
really were her enemies. What did she care, anyway,
what that Joe Barron thought? Then, once more, a
doubt assailed her. What if he were right? Not
that she would admit it, for one moment. But just
supposing! Was she going to pour hot water on
those porcupines, and scald all the bristles off their
backs, if they really <i>didn&#8217;t</i> come after her eggs?
Mrs. Gammit was essentially just and kind-hearted,
and she came to the conclusion that the scheme might
be too cruel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ef it be you uns as takes the aigs,&#8221; she murmured
thoughtfully, &#8220;a kittle o&#8217; bilin&#8217; water to yer backs
ain&#8217;t none too bad fer ye! But ef it be <i>only</i> my old
herrin&#8217;-tub ye&#8217;re after, then bilin&#8217; water&#8217;s too
ha&#8217;sh!&#8221;</p>
<p>In the end, the weapon she decided upon was the
big tin pepper-pot, well loaded.</p>
<p>Through the twilight, while the yard was all in
shadow, Mrs. Gammit sat patient and motionless
beside her open window. The moon rose, seeming to
climb with effort out of the tangle of far-off treetops.
The faint, rhythmic breathing of the wilderness,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
which, to the sensitive ear, never ceases even in the
most profound calm, took on the night change,
the whisper of mystery, the furtive suggestion of
menace which the daylight lacks. Sitting there in
ambush, Mrs. Gammit felt it all, and her eager face
grew still and pale and solemn like a statue&#8217;s.
The moonlight crept down the roofs of the barn and
shed and house, then down the walls, till only the
ground was in shadow. And at last, through this
lower stratum of obscurity, Mrs. Gammit saw two
squat, sturdy shapes approaching leisurely from
behind the barn.</p>
<p>She held her breath. Yes, it was undoubtedly
the porcupines. Undaunted by the memory of
their previous discomfiture, they came straight across
the yard, and up to the house, and fell at once to
their feasting on the herring-tub. The noise of their
enthusiastic gnawing echoed strangely across the
attentive air.</p>
<p>Very gently, with almost imperceptible motion,
Mrs. Gammit slid her right hand, armed with the
pepper-pot, over the edge of the window-sill. The
porcupines, enraptured with the flavour of the
herring-tub, never looked up. Mrs. Gammit was
just about to turn the pepper-pot over, when she
saw a third dim shape approaching, and stayed her
hand. It was bigger than a porcupine. She kept
very still, breathing noiselessly through parted lips.
Then the moonlight reached the ground, the shadows
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
vanished, and she saw a big wildcat stealing up to
find out what the porcupines were eating.</p>
<p>Seeing the feasters so confident and noisy, yet
undisturbed, the usually cautious wildcat seemed to
think there could be no danger near. Had Mrs.
Gammit stirred a muscle, he would have marked
her; but in her movelessness her head and hand
passed for some harmless natural phenomenon.
The wildcat crept softly up, and as he drew near,
the porcupines raised their quills threateningly, till
nothing could be seen of their bodies but their blunt
snouts still busy on the herring-tub. At a distance
of about six feet the big cat stopped, and
crouched, glaring with wide, pale eyes, and sniffing
eagerly. Mrs. Gammit was amazed that the porcupines
did not at once discharge a volley at him and
fill him full of quills for his intrusion.</p>
<p>The wildcat knew too much about porcupines to
dream of attacking them. It was what they were
eating that interested him. They seemed to enjoy
it so much. He crept a few inches nearer, and
caught a whiff of the herring-tub. Yes, it was
certainly fish. A true cat, he doted on fish, even
salt fish. He made another cautious advance,
hoping that the porcupines might retire discreetly.
But instead of that they merely stopped gnawing,
put their noses between their forelegs, squatted
flat, and presented an unbroken array of needle
points to his dangerous approach.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></p>
<p>The big cat stopped, quite baffled, his little short
tail, not more than three inches long, twitching
with anger. He could not see that the tub was
empty; but he could smell it, and he drew in his
breath with noisy sniffling. It filled him with
rage to be so baffled; for he knew it would be fatal
to go any nearer, and so expose himself to a deadly
slap from the armed tails of the porcupines.</p>
<p>Just what he would have attempted, however,
in his eagerness, will never be known. For at this
point, Mrs. Gammit&#8217;s impatience overcame her
curiosity. With a gentle motion of her wrist she
turned the pepper-pot over, and softly shook it. The
eyes of the wildcat were fixed upon that wonderful,
unattainable herring-tub, and he saw nothing
else. But Mrs. Gammit in the vivid moonlight saw
a fine cloud of pepper sinking downwards slowly on
the moveless air.</p>
<p>Suddenly the wildcat pawed at his nose, drew
back, and grew rigid with what seemed an effort
to restrain some deep emotion. The next moment
he gave vent to a loud, convulsive sneeze, and began
to spit savagely. He appeared to be not only very
angry, but surprised as well. When he fell to clawing
frantically at his eyes and nose with both paws, Mrs.
Gammit almost strangled with the effort to keep
from laughing. But she held herself in, and continued
to shake down the pungent shower. A
moment more, and the wildcat, after an explosion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
of sneezes which almost made him stand on his head,
gave utterance to a yowl of consternation, and turned
to flee. As he bounded across the yard he evidently
did not see just where he was going, for
he ran head first into the wheelbarrow, which
straightway upset and kicked him. For an instant
he clawed at it wildly, mistaking it for a living assailant.
Then he recovered his wits a little, and scurried
away across the pasture, sneezing and spitting
as he went.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the porcupines, with their noses to the
ground and their eyes covered, had been escaping
the insidious attack of the pepper. But at last it
reached them. Mrs. Gammit saw a curious shiver
pass over the array of quills.</p>
<p>Now it was contrary to all the most rigid laws of
the porcupine kind to uncoil themselves in the face
of danger. At the same time, it was impossible
to sneeze in so constrained an attitude. Their
effort was heroic, but self-control at last gave way.
As it were with a snap, one of the globes of quills
straightened itself out, and sneezed and sneezed and
sneezed. Then the other went through the same
spasmodic process, while Mrs. Gammit, leaning halfway
out of the window, squealed and choked with delight.
But the porcupines were obstinate, and would
not run away. Very slowly they turned and retired
down the yard, halting every few feet to sneeze. With
tears streaming down her cheeks Mrs. Gammit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
watched their retreat, till suddenly some of the
vagrant pepper was wafted back to her own nostrils,
and she herself was shaken with a mighty sneeze.
This checked her mirth on the instant. Her face
grew grave, and drawing back with a mortified air
she slammed the window down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Might &#8217;a&#8217; knowed I&#8217;d be aketchin&#8217; cold,&#8221; she
muttered, &#8220;settin&#8217; in a draught this time o&#8217; night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not until she had thoroughly mastered the
tickling in her nostrils did she glance forth again.
Then the porcupines were gone, and not even an
echo of their far-off sneezes reached her ears.</p>
<p>In the days that followed, neither weasel, wildcat,
nor porcupine came to Mrs. Gammit&#8217;s clearing, and
the daily harvest of strictly fresh eggs was unfailing.
At the end of a week, the good lady felt justified in
returning the traps to Joe Barron, and letting him
know how mistaken he had been.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, Mr. Barron,&#8221; said she, handing him the
three traps, &#8220;I&#8217;m obleeged to you, an&#8217; there&#8217;s yer
traps. But there&#8217;s one of &#8217;em ain&#8217;t no good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which one be it?&#8221; asked the woodsman as he took
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve marked it with a bit of string,&#8221; replied Mrs.
Gammit.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with it? I don&#8217;t see nawthin&#8217;
wrong with it!&#8221; said Barron, examining it critically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tain&#8217;t no good! You take my word fer it!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
That&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve got to say!&#8221; persisted Mrs. Gammit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, seem&#8217; as it&#8217;s you sez so, Mrs. Gammit,
that&#8217;s enough,&#8221; agreed the woodsman, civilly. &#8220;But
the other is all right, eh? What did they ketch?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they ketched a big weasel!&#8221; said Mrs.
Gammit, eyeing him with challenge.</p>
<p>A broad smile went over Barron&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knowed it,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I knowed as how
it was a weasel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; <i>I</i> knowed as how ye&#8217;d say jest them very
words,&#8221; retorted Mrs. Gammit. &#8220;But ye don&#8217;t
know everythin&#8217;, Joe Barron. It wa&#8217;n&#8217;t no weasel
as was takin&#8217; them there aigs!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What were it then?&#8221; demanded the woodsman,
incredulously.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was two big porkypines an&#8217; a monstrous big
wildcat,&#8221; answered Mrs. Gammit in triumph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did ye ketch &#8217;em at it?&#8221; asked the woodsman,
with a faint note of sarcasm in his voice. But the
sarcasm glanced off Mrs. Gammit&#8217;s armour. She
regarded the question as a quite legitimate one.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I kain&#8217;t say as I did, <i>exackly</i>,&#8221; she replied.
&#8220;But they come anosin&#8217; round, an&#8217; to teach &#8217;em a
lesson to keep ther noses out o&#8217; other people&#8217;s hens&#8217;
nests I shook a little pepper over &#8217;em. I tell ye, they
took to the woods, asneezin&#8217; that bad I thought
ye might &#8217;a&#8217; heard &#8217;em all the way over here.
Ye&#8217;d &#8217;ave bust yerself laffin&#8217;, ef ye could &#8217;a&#8217; seed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
&#8217;em rootin&#8217;. An&#8217; since then, Mr. Barron, I git
all the aigs I want. Don&#8217;t ye talk to me o&#8217; <i>weasels</i>&ndash;&ndash;the
skinny little rats. <i>They</i> ain&#8217;t wuth noticin&#8217;,

<h2><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>The Battle in the Mist</span></h2>
</div>
<p>In the silver-grey between dawn and sunrise the
river was filled with mist from bank to bank. It
coiled and writhed and rolled, here thinning, there
thickening, as if breathed upon irregularly by
innumerable unseen mouths. But there was no
wind astir; and the brown-black, glistening current
beneath the white folds was glassy smooth save
where the occasional big swirls boiled up with a
swishing gurgle, or the running wave broke musically
around an upthrust shoulder of rock or a weedy
snag. The river was not wide&ndash;&ndash;not more than
fifty yards from bank to bank; but from the
birch canoe slipping quietly down along one shore,
just outside the fringe of alder branches, the opposite
shore was absolutely hidden. There was
nothing to indicate that an opposite shore existed,
save that now and again the dark top of a soaring
pine or elm would show dimly for a moment, seeming
to float above the ghostly gulfs of mist.</p>
<p>The canoe kept close along the shore for guidance,
as one feels one&#8217;s way along a wall in the dark. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
channel, moreover, was deep and clear in shore;
while out under the mist the soft noises of ripples
proclaimed to the ears of the two canoeists the presence
of frequent rock and snag and shallow. Lest
they should run upon unseen dangers ahead, the
canoeists were travelling very slowly, the bow-man
resting with his paddle across the gunwales before
him, while the stern-man, his paddle noiselessly
waving like the fin of a trout, did no more
than keep his craft to her course and let her run
with the current.</p>
<p>Down along the shore, keeping just behind the
canoe and close to the water&#8217;s edge, followed a
small, dark, sinuous creature, its piercing eyes,
bead-black with a glint of red behind them, fixed in
savage curiosity upon the canoemen. It was about
two feet in length, with extremely short legs, and a
sharp, triangular head. As it ran&ndash;&ndash;and its movements
were as soundless and effortless as those of
a snake&ndash;&ndash;it humped its long, lithe body in a way
that suggested a snake&#8217;s coils. It seemed to be
following the canoe out of sheer curiosity&ndash;&ndash;a
curiosity, however, which was probably well mixed
with malevolence, seeing that it was the curiosity
of a mink. These two strange creatures moving on
the water were, of course, too large and formidable
for the big mink to dream of attacking them;
but he could wonder at them and hate them&ndash;&ndash;and
who could say that some chance to do them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
a hurt might not arise? Stealthy, wary, and bold,
he kept his distance about eight or ten feet from
the canoe; and because he was behind he imagined
himself unseen. As a matter of fact, however, the
steersman of the canoe, wiser in woodcraft and
cunninger even than he, had detected him and
was watching him with interest from the corner
of his eye. So large a mink, and one so daring in
curiosity, was a phenomenon to be watched and
studied with care. The canoeist did not take his
comrade in the bow into his confidence for some
minutes, lest the sound of the human voice should
daunt the animal. But presently, in a monotonous,
rhythmic murmur which carried no alarm to the
mink&#8217;s ear but only heightened its interest, he
called the situation to his companion&#8217;s notice;
and the latter, without seeming to see, kept watch
through half-closed lids.</p>
<p>A little way down the shore, close to the water&#8217;s
edge, something round and white caught the mink&#8217;s
eye. Against the soft browns and dark greys of the
wet soil, the object fairly shone in its whiteness, and
seemed absurdly out of place. It was a hen&#8217;s
egg, either dropped there by a careless hen from the
pioneer&#8217;s cabin near by, or left by a musk-rat disturbed
in his poaching. However it had got there,
it was an egg; and the canoeists saw that they no
longer held the mink&#8217;s undivided attention. Gently
the steersman sheered out a few feet farther from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
the bank, and at the same time checked the canoe&#8217;s
headway. He wanted to see how the mink would
manipulate the egg when he got to it.</p>
<p>The egg lay at the foot of a little path which led
down the bushy bank to the water&ndash;&ndash;a path evidently
trodden by the pioneer&#8217;s cattle. Down
this path, stepping daintily and turning his long
inquisitive nose and big, bright, mischievous eyes
from side to side, came a raccoon. He was a small
raccoon, a little shorter than the mink, but looking
heavier by reason of his more stocky build and
bushier, looser fur. His purpose was to fish or
hunt frogs in the pool at the foot of the path; but
when he saw the egg gleaming through the misty
air, his eyes sparkled with satisfaction. A long
summer passed in proximity to the pioneer&#8217;s cabin
had enabled him to find out that eggs were good.
He hastened his steps, and with a sliding scramble,
which attracted the attention of the men in the
canoe, he arrived at the water&#8217;s edge. But to his
indignant astonishment he was not the first to
arrive.</p>
<p>The mink was just ahead. He reached the egg,
laid one paw upon it in possession, and turned with a
snarl of defiance as the raccoon came down the
bank. The latter paused to note the threatening
fangs and malign eyes of his slim rival. Then, with
that brisk gaiety which the raccoon carries into the
most serious affairs of his life, and particularly into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
his battles, he ran to the encounter. The men in the
canoe, eagerly interested, stole nearer to referee the
match.</p>
<p>Quick as the raccoon was, his snake-like adversary
was quicker. Doubling back upon himself, the
mink avoided that confident and dangerous rush, and
with a lightning snap fixed hold upon his enemy&#8217;s
neck. But it was not, by half an inch, the hold
he wanted; and his long, deadly teeth sank not, as
he had planned, into the foe&#8217;s throat, but into the
great tough muscles a little higher up. He dared
not let go to try for the deadlier hold, but locked his
jaws and whipped his long body over the other&#8217;s back,
hoping to evade his antagonist&#8217;s teeth.</p>
<p>The raccoon had lost the first point, and his large
eyes blazed with pain and anger. But his dauntless
spirit was not in the least dismayed. Shaking
the long, black body from his back, he swung himself
half round and caught his enemy&#8217;s slim loins between
his jaws. It was a cruelly punishing grip,
and under the stress of it the mink lashed out so violently
that the two, still holding on with locked
jaws, rolled over into the water, smashing the egg as
they fell. The canoe, now close beside them, they
heeded not at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two to one on the mink!&#8221; whispered the traveller
in the bow of the canoe, delightedly. But the steersman
smiled, and said &#8220;Wait!&#8221;</p>
<p>To be in the water suited the mink well enough. A
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
hunter of fish in their holes, he was almost as much
at home in the water as a fish. But the raccoon it
did not suit at all. With a splutter he relinquished
his hold on the mink&#8217;s loins; and the latter, perceiving
the advantage, let go and snapped again for
the throat. But again he miscalculated the alertness
of the raccoon&#8217;s sturdy muscles. The latter had
turned his head the instant that the mink&#8217;s jaws
relaxed, and the two gnashed teeth in each other&#8217;s
faces, neither securing a hold. The next moment
the raccoon had leaped back to dry land, turning in
threatening readiness as he did so.</p>
<p>Though there was no longer anything to fight
about, the mink&#8217;s blood was up. His eyes glowed
like red coals, his long, black shape looked very
fit and dangerous, and his whole appearance was that
of vindictive fury. The raccoon, on the other hand,
though bedraggled from his ducking, maintained his
gay, casual air, as if enjoying the whole affair
too much to be thoroughly enraged. When the
mink darted upon him, straight as a snake strikes,
he met the attack with a curious little pirouette;
and the next instant the two were once more locked
in a death grapple.</p>
<p>It was some moments before the breathless
watchers in the canoe could make out which was
getting the advantage, so closely were the grey
body and the black intertwined. Then it was seen
that the raccoon was using his flexible, hand-like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
paws as a bear might, to hold his foe down to the
punishment. Both contestants were much cut, and
bleeding freely; but the mink was now getting
slow, while the raccoon was as cheerfully alert as
ever. At length the mink tore loose and made one
more desperate reach for his favourite throat-hold.
But this time it was the raccoon who avoided. He
danced aside, flashed back, and caught the mink
fairly under the jaw. Then, bracing himself, he
shook his foe as a terrier might. And in a minute
or two the long, black shape straightened out
limply amid the sand and dead leaves.</p>
<p>When the body was quite still the raccoon let
go and stood over it expectantly for some minutes.
He bit it several times, and seeing that this treatment
elicited no retort, suffered himself to feel
assured of his victory. Highly pleased, he skipped
back and forth over the body, playfully seized it
with his fore-paws, and bundled it up into a heap.
Then seeming to remember the origin of the quarrel,
he sniffed regretfully at the crumbled fragments
of egg-shell. His expression of disappointment was
so ludicrous that in spite of themselves the men in
the canoe exploded with laughter.</p>
<p>As the harsh, incongruous sound startled the
white stillnesses, in the lifting of an eyelid the little
conqueror vanished. One of the canoeists stepped
ashore, picked up the body of the slain mink, and
threw it into the canoe. As the two resumed their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
paddles and slipped away into the mist, they knew
that from some hiding-place on the bank two
bright, indignant eyes were peering after them in
wonder.</p>

<h2><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Melindy and the Spring Bear</span></h2>
</div>
<p>Soft, wet and tender, with a faint green filming
the sodden pasture field, and a rose-pink veil
covering the maples, and blue-grey catkins tinting
the dark alders, spring had come to the lonely little
clearing in the backwoods. From the swampy
meadow along the brook&#8217;s edge, across the road from
the cabin and the straw-littered barn-yard, came
toward evening that music which is the distinctive
note of the northern spring&ndash;&ndash;the thrilling, mellow,
inexpressibly wistful fluting of the frogs.</p>
<p>The sun was just withdrawing his uppermost
rim behind the far-off black horizon line of fir-tops.
The cabin door stood wide open to admit the sweet
air and the sweet sound. Just inside the door
sat old Mrs. Griffis, rocking heavily, while the woollen
sock which she was knitting lay forgotten in her
lap. She was a strong-featured, muscular woman,
still full of vigour, whom rheumatism had met and
halted in the busy path of life. Her keen and restless
eyes were following eagerly every movement of a
slender, light-haired girl in a blue cotton waist
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
and grey homespun skirt, who was busy at the
other side of the yard, getting her little flock of
sheep penned up for the night for fear of wild
prowlers.</p>
<p>Presently the girl slammed the pen door, jammed
the hardwood peg into the staple, ran her fingers
nervously through the pale fluff of her hair, and
came hurrying across the yard to the door with a
smile on her delicate young face.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>There</i>, Granny!&#8221; she exclaimed, with the air
of one who has just got a number of troublesome
little duties accomplished, &#8220;I guess no lynxes, or
nothing, &#8217;ll get the sheep to-night, anyways. Now,
I must go an&#8217; hunt up old &#8216;Spotty&#8217; afore it gets too
dark. I don&#8217;t see what&#8217;s made her wander off to-day.
She always sticks around the barn close as a
burr!&#8221;</p>
<p>The old woman smiled, knowing that the survival
of a wild instinct in the cow had led her to seek
some hiding-place, near home but secluded, wherein
to secrete her new-born calf.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess old &#8216;Spotty&#8217; knows enough to come
home when she gets ready, Child!&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;She&#8217;s been kept that close all winter, the snow
bein&#8217; so deep, I don&#8217;t wonder she wants to roam a
bit now she can git &#8217;round. Land sakes, I wish&#8217;t <i>I</i>
could roam a bit, &#8217;stead er sittin&#8217;, sittin&#8217;, an&#8217; knittin&#8217;,
knittin&#8217;, mornin&#8217;, noon an&#8217; night, all along of these
&#8217;ere useless old legs of mine!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Granny!&#8221; murmured the girl, softly, tears
coming into her eyes. &#8220;I wish&#8217;t we could get
&#8217;round, the two of us, in these sweet-smellin&#8217; spring
woods, an&#8217; get the first Mayflowers together!
Couldn&#8217;t you just try now, Granny? I believe
you are goin&#8217; to walk all right again some day, just
as well as any of us. Do try!&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus adjured, the old woman grasped the arms
of her chair sturdily, set her jaw, and lifted herself
quite upright. But a groan forced itself from her
lips, and she sank back heavily, her face creased
with pain. Recovering herself with a resolute
effort, however, she smiled rather ruefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some day, mebbe, if the good Lord wills!&#8221;
said she, shaking her head. &#8220;But &#8217;tain&#8217;t this day,
Melindy! You&#8217;ll be the death o&#8217; me yet, Child,
you&#8217;re so set on me gittin&#8217; &#8217;round ag&#8217;in!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Granny, you did splendid!&#8221; cried the
girl. &#8220;That was the best yet, the best you&#8217;ve
ever done since I come to you. You stood just as
straight as anybody for a minute. Now, I&#8217;ll go
an&#8217; hunt old &#8216;Spotty.&#8217;&#8221; And she turned toward
the tiny path that led across the pasture to the
burnt-woods.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Griffis&#8217;s voice detained her.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the good o&#8217; botherin&#8217; about old &#8216;Spotty&#8217;
to-night, Melindy? Let her have her fling. Them
frogs make me that lonesome to-night I can&#8217;t
bear to let ye a minnit out o&#8217; my sight, Child!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
Ther&#8217; ain&#8217;t no other sound like it, to my way
o&#8217; thinkin&#8217;, for music nor for lonesomeness. It
&#8217;most breaks my heart with the sweetness of it,
risin&#8217; an&#8217; fallin&#8217; on the wet twilight that way.
But I just got to have somebody &#8217;round when I
listen to it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Granny, I love it, too!&#8221; assented Melindy
in a preoccupied tone, &#8220;when I ain&#8217;t too bothered
to listen. Just now, I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217; about old &#8216;Spotty&#8217;
out there alone in the woods, an&#8217; maybe some
hungry lynxes watchin&#8217; for her to lie down an&#8217; go
to sleep. You know how hungry the bears will be
this spring, too, Granny, after the snow layin&#8217; deep
so late. I just couldn&#8217;t sleep, if I thought old
&#8216;Spotty&#8217; was out there in them queer, grey, empty
woods all night. In summer it&#8217;s different, an&#8217;
then the woods are like home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said her grandmother, seeing that the
girl was bent upon her purpose, &#8220;if ye&#8217;re skeered
for old &#8216;Spotty,&#8217; ye&#8217;d better be a little mite skeered
for yerself, Child! Take along the gun. Mebbe
ye might see a chipmunk a-bitin&#8217; the old cow jest
awful!&#8221;</p>
<p>Heedless of her grandmother&#8217;s gibe, Melindy, who
had a very practical brain under her fluffy light
hair, picked up the handy little axe which she used
for chopping kindling.</p>
<p>&#8220;No guns for me, Granny, you know,&#8221; she retorted.
&#8220;This &#8217;ere little axe&#8217;s good enough for me!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
And swinging it over her shoulder she went lightly
up the path, her head to one side, her small mouth
puckered in a vain effort to learn to whistle.</p>
<p>What Melindy and her grandmother called the
&#8220;Burnt Lands&#8221; was a strip of country running
back for miles from the clearing. The fire had
gone over it years before, cutting a sharply defined,
gradually widening path through the forest, and
leaving behind it only a few scattered rampikes, or
tall, naked trunks bleached to whiteness by the
storms of many winters. Here and there amid
these desolate spaces, dense thickets of low growth
had sprung up, making a secure hiding-place of
every hollow where the soil had not had all the life
scorched out of it.</p>
<p>Having crossed the pasture, Melindy presently
detected those faint indications of a trail which the
uninitiated eye finds it so impossible to see. Slight
bendings and bruises of the blueberry and laurel
scrub caught her notice. Then she found, in a
bare spot, the unmistakable print of a cow&#8217;s hoof.
The trail was now quite clear to her; and it was
clearly that of old &#8220;Spotty.&#8221; Intent upon her
quest she hurried on, heedless of the tender colours
changing in the sky above her head, of the first
swallows flitting and twittering across it, of the
keen yet delicate fragrance escaping from every
sap-swollen bud, and of the sweetly persuasive
piping of the frogs from the water meadow. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
had no thought at that moment but to find the
truant cow and get her safely stabled before dark.</p>
<p>The trail led directly to a rocky hollow about a
hundred yards from the edge of the pasture&ndash;&ndash;perhaps
a hundred and fifty yards from the doorway
wherein Mrs. Griffis sat intently watching Melindy&#8217;s
progress. The hollow was thick with young spruce
and white birch, clustered about a single tall and
massive rampike.</p>
<p>Into this shadowy tangle the girl pushed fearlessly,
peering ahead beneath the dark, balsam-scented
branches. She could see, in a broken fashion, to
the very foot of the rampike, across which lay a huge
fallen trunk. But she could see nothing of old
&#8220;Spotty,&#8221; who, by reason of her vivid colouring
of red and white splotches, would have been conspicuous
against those dark surroundings.</p>
<p>There was something in the silence, combined
with the absence of the cow whom she confidently
expected to find, which sent a little chill to the
girl&#8217;s heart. She gripped her axe more tightly, and
stood quite motionless, accustoming her eyes to the
confused gloom; and presently she thought she
could distinguish a small brownish shape lying on
a mound of moss near the foot of the rampike. A
moment more and she could see that it was looking
at her, with big, soft eyes. Then a pair of big ears
moved. She realized that it was a calf she was
looking at. Old &#8220;Spotty&#8217;s&#8221; truancy was accounted for.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></p>
<p>But where was old &#8220;Spotty&#8221;? Melindy thought
for a moment, and concluded very properly that
the mother, considering the calf well-hidden, had
slipped away to the spring for a drink. She was on
the point of stepping forward to admire the little
new-comer and see if it was yet strong enough to
be led home to the barn, when a stealthy rustling
at the farther side of the thicket arrested her.</p>
<p>Certainly that could not be the cow, who was
anything but stealthy in her movements. But what
could it be?</p>
<p>Melindy had a sudden prescience of peril. But
her nerves stiffened to it, and she had no thought of
retreat. It might be one of those savage lynxes,
spying upon the calf in its mother&#8217;s absence. At
this idea Melindy&#8217;s small mouth itself set very grimly,
and she rejoiced that she had brought the axe along.
The lynx, of all the wild creatures, she regarded
with special antagonism.</p>
<p>The stealthy movements came nearer, nearer,
then suddenly died out. A moment more and a
dark bulk took shape noiselessly among the fir-branches,
some ten or twelve feet beyond the spot
where the helpless calf was lying.</p>
<p>For a second Melindy&#8217;s heart stood still. What
was her little axe against a bear! Then she recalled
the general backwoods faith that the biggest black
bear would run from a human being, if only he had
plenty of room to run. She looked at the helpless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
little one curled up on its mossy bed. She looked
at the savage black shape gliding slowly forward to
devour it. And her heart leaped with returning
courage.</p>
<p>The bear, its fierce eyes glancing from side to
side, was now within five or six feet of its intended
prey. With a shrill cry of warning and defiance
Melindy sprang forward, swinging her axe, and ordered
the beast to &#8220;Git out!&#8221; She was greatly in hopes
that the animal would yield to the authority of the
human voice, and retire abashed.</p>
<p>At any other season, it is probable that the bear
would have done just as she hoped it would. But
now, it had the courage of a rampant spring appetite.
Startled it was, and disturbed, at the girl&#8217;s sudden
appearance and her shrill cry; and it half drew
back, hesitating. But Melindy also hesitated; and
the bear was quick to perceive her hesitation. For a
few seconds he stood eyeing her, his head down and
swinging from side to side. Then, seeming to conclude
that she was not a formidable antagonist,
he gave vent to a loud, grunting growl, and lurched
forward upon the calf.</p>
<p>With a wild scream, half of fury, half of fear,
Melindy also darted forward, trusting that the
animal would not really face her onslaught. And
the calf, terrified at the sudden outcry, staggered
to its feet with a loud bleating.</p>
<p>The bear was just upon it, with great black paw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
uplifted for the fatal stroke that would have broken
its back, when he saw Melindy&#8217;s axe descending.
With the speed of a skilled boxer he changed the
direction of his stroke, and fended off the blow so
cleverly that the axe almost flew from the girl&#8217;s
grasp. The fine edge, however, caught a partial
hold, and cleft the paw to the bone.</p>
<p>Furious with the pain, and his fighting blood now
thoroughly aroused, the bear forgot the calf and
sprang at his daring assailant. Light-footed as a
cat, the girl leapt aside, just in time, darted over
the fallen trunk, and dodged around the base of
the rampike. She realized that she had undertaken
too much, and her only hope now was that either
she would be able to outrun the bear, or that the
latter would turn his attentions again to the calf and
forget about her.</p>
<p>The bear, however, had no intention of letting her
escape his vengeance. For all his bulk, he was
amazingly nimble and was at her heels again in a
second. Though she might have outstripped him
in the open, he would probably have caught her in
the hampering thicket; but at this crucial moment
there came a bellow and a crashing of branches
close behind him, and he whirled about just in time
to receive the raging charge of old &#8220;Spotty,&#8221; who
had heard her youngster&#8217;s call.</p>
<p>The bear had no time to dodge or fend this onslaught,
but only to brace himself. The cow&#8217;s horns,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
unfortunately, were short and wide-spreading. She
caught him full in the chest, with the force of a
battering-ram, and would have hurled him backwards
but that his mighty claws and forearms,
at the same instant, secured a deadly clutch upon
her shoulders. She bore him backward against
the trunk indeed, but there he recovered himself;
and when she strove to withdraw for another battering
charge, she could not tear herself free. Foiled
in these tactics, she lunged forward with all her
strength, again and again, bellowing madly, and
endeavouring to crush out her enemy&#8217;s breath
against the tree. And the bear, grunting, growling,
and whining, held her fast while he tore at her with
his deadly claws.</p>
<p>Too much excited to think any longer of flight,
Melindy stood upon the fallen trunk and breathlessly
watched the battle. In a few moments she realized
that old &#8220;Spotty&#8221; was getting the worst of it;
and upon this her courage once more returned.
Running down the great log as close as she dared,
she swung up her axe, and paused for an opening.
She was just about to strike, when a well-known
voice arrested her, and she jumped back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Git out of the way, Child,&#8221; it commanded,
piercing the turmoil. &#8220;Git out of the way an&#8217; let
me shoot!&#8221;</p>
<p>The crippled old woman, too, had heard the cry
of her young. When that scream of Melindy&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
cleft the evening air, Mrs. Griffis had shot out of her
chair as if she had never heard of rheumatism. She
did not know anything hurt her. At the summons
of this imperious need her old vigour all came back.
Snatching up the big duck-gun from the corner,
where it stood always loaded and ready, she went
across the pasture and through the laurel patches
at a pace almost worthy of Melindy herself. When
she plunged through the bushes into the hollow,
and saw the situation, her iron will steadied her
nerves to meet the crisis.</p>
<p>The instant Melindy had jumped out of the way
Mrs. Griffis ran close up to the combatants. The
bear was being kept too busy to spare her any attention
whatever. Coolly setting the muzzle of the
big gun (which was loaded with buckshot) close
to the beast&#8217;s side, just behind the fore-shoulder,
she pulled the trigger. There was a roar that filled
the hollow like the firing of a cannon, and the bear
collapsed sprawling, with a great hole blown through
his heart.</p>
<p>Old &#8220;Spotty&#8221; drew back astonished, snorted
noisily, and rolled wild eyes upon her mistress.
Then, unable to believe that her late foe was really
no longer a menace to her precious calf, she fell
once more upon the lifeless form and tried to beat
it out of all likeness to a bear. The calf, who had
been knocked over but not hurt in the bear&#8217;s charge
upon Melindy, had struggled to its feet again; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
Mrs. Griffis pushed it forward to attract its mother&#8217;s
attention. This move proved successful; and presently,
in the task of licking the little creature
all over to make sure it was not hurt, &#8220;Spotty&#8221;
forgot her noble rage. Then, slowly and patiently,
by pushing, pulling, and coaxing, the two women
got the calf up out of the hollow and along the homeward
path, while the mother, heedless of her streaming
wounds, crowded against them, mooing softly
with satisfaction. She was craving now, for her
little one, the safe shelter of the barn-yard.</p>
<p>At the well the quaint procession stopped, and
the calf fell to nursing; while Melindy washed the
cow&#8217;s wounds, and Mrs. Griffis hunted up some tar
to use as a salve upon them. As she moved briskly
about the yard, Melindy broke into a peal of joyous
but almost hysterical laughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I declare to goodness, Granny,&#8221; she cried, in
response to the old woman&#8217;s questioning look, &#8220;if
you ain&#8217;t just as spry as me. I&#8217;ve heard tell that
bear&#8217;s grease was a great medicine for rheumatism.
It&#8217;s plain to be seen, Granny, that you&#8217;ve used up
a whole bear for yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t the bear, Child!&#8221; answered the old
woman, gravely. &#8220;It was that ter&#8217;ble scream o&#8217;
yours cured my rheumatiz! Old &#8216;Spotty,&#8217; she
come to her young one&#8217;s call. Could I do less, Child,
when I heerd my little one cry out fer me?&#8221;</p>

remarkable Dartmoor tales. If Shakespeare had written novels we can
think that some of his pages would have been like some of these. Here
certainly is language, turn of humor, philosophical play, vigor of incident,
such as might have come straight from Elizabeth&#8217;s day.... The book
is full of a very moving interest and is agreeable and beautiful.&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;<i>The New York Sun</i>.</p>
